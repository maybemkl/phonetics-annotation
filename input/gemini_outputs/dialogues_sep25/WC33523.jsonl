Besides, I am convinced that I am fitted for something; and, if I can strike that, I can make a success of it.

They keep to their study, satisfied with just enough to live on, and to keep themselves supplied with material for experiment, seemingly content with the results they produce in a scientific way.

{"utterance": "Don't be sarcastic, Ben. The more I think of it the more I become convinced that there's your grand opportunity. To begin at the beginning: when I was State Assayer, three years ago, an old man came to me for information as to the best place to find a certain mineral. I did not have the desired information at my tongue's end, so promised to look it up for him. But he did n't leave just then, and both of us soon became interested in conversation. I found. him immensely entertaining and very deep in study, and learned that he was away from home and staying in C to investigate the peculiar characteristics of some of the minerals there. In leaving he gave me his name and invited me to call. I took advantage of the invitation, and there made the acquaintance of his daughter Mabel a most charming girl. Well, it was n't quite the old, old story, but something near it. If I only had money - but that's foreign to the subject. After awhile he left C, and took her with him. But she and I have kept up a correspondence ever since, and when I came here the other day I called, - for they live on the outskirts of this city, and there had a glimpse of the old man's ability. But this was in the afternoon. Mabel entertained me, because Mr. Alder was busy, so I did n't see much of his work.

Then they gossip about him, I suppose, tell all sorts of queer stories concerning him, and take a peculiar delight in watching his house; they hear strange noises; see great volumes of smoke and steam escape from the chimney by day, and fire by night; they do not understand an inventor's devotion to his work, or his horror of annoyance; so they persist in their gossip and watching.

The\nresult under their proposition would be, that we,\nwho risk our money in this venture, would have,\npractically, no voice as to the way in which that\nmoney should be used. If we subscribe for this\none-quarter interest, theoretically we have\npower in the management of the company to the\nextent of that quarter interest, but actually we\nhave none as long as the other three-quarters\nremain where they are.

For many years, the\npopular old-time theory of a passage beneath\n85\nthe Isthmus of Panama, connecting the Pacific\nand Atlantic oceans, through which the current\nof the Gulf Stream received its impetus from\nthe pressure continually exerted by the higher\nlevel of the Pacific, has been frowned upon, and\nother theories, more or less worthy of attention,\nhave obtained a place in the scientific works of\nour schools and colleges. If there has ever\nbeen a lingering doubt in the mind of any one\nas to which of the theories advanced was cor-\nrect, the spectacle we have this day witnessed,\nremoves it. Nothing is wanting to prove, that\nthe passage did exist, and that the narrow neck\nof land connecting the northern and southern\ncontinents of America was\na great natural\nbridge. The archway through which the initial\nforce of the Gulf Stream was constantly ex-\nerted, was large enough to allow of the con-\nstant flow of water toward the north, yet small\nenough to admit only just so much as might\nbecome heated by the rays of the sun in the\nvast basin of the Gulf of Mexico, before being\nforced upon its journey and mission toward the\nfar north.\nBy the heat which this stream carried with it,\n\u2022\nthe temperature along the whole line was raised\nto a degree that rendered the climate of the\neastern coast of America, and the whole of\nsouthern Europe, agreeable. Now, however,\nall is changed. Gentlemen, I tremble for the\nresult. Not only will some inhabitable por-\ntions of the Windward Islands be submerged\nby this rise of oceanic level; but, in the onward\nsweep of this tremendous current, will it not\nbring other disasters in its train? Now, there\nwill be no pause for the tropical sun to exert a\ngenial influence on the cold waters of the Pacific,\nnothing but one great, onward rush of chilling\nwater. The borders of the Arctic region, which\nhave been held in check by the warmer current,\nwill necessarily be enlarged by its withdrawal,\nand there can be no possible estimate put upon\nthe attendant dangers to commerce. Drift ice\nwill henceforth be a terror to navigation, and\nthe icy blasts of Arctic winters will very much\nlower the present thermal line. The tempera-\nture of the eastern and southern coast of North\nAmerica, of England, and perhaps of Southern\nEurope, will be changed. The vinelands of\nFrance will suffer; and upon the projectors\n87\nof this ill-advised enterprise all blame must\nbe laid.

Shall I say anything about Van Rense's proposed change?", "speaker": "Albin Hamilton", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Bernard Rehkopf", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "No, I think you had better not.

When the time comes I go to bed; but when I get up I feel jolly, and as light as a feather. Mr. Alder says I shall live for a hundred years, and not grow old, except in years, and when that time is up, I can go through the process again and live for another hundred. In short, I am in no danger of death except by accident, getting crushed, drowned, blown up, or something of that kind.

Night before last, while I was out here alone, I saw great points of flame shoot up from that very spot; and this morning, at the station, I overheard some people talking about a queer genius who lives up there, some one who is continually at work upon some new plan to perform great things.

I am going to see him, and soon; to-morrow night, I think. I will see him; it will do us no harm, and in such an interview I shall have every advantage. I will worm from him what he intends doing.

O God! keep me from myself; crush me beneath a greater load of sorrow, if it be possible, but not this, not this; let me die! let me die! sober and calm, I pray.

If I know the man and his character at all, he considers his part performed, and would be willing to accede to almost any plan we might make. He places implicit confidence in us. Now the question is, whether we shall take advantage of the trust he reposes in us, and get the best bargain possible for ourselves, or whether we shall yield to him willingly what another man of more business training would fight for and undoubtedly get. He has already, in giving us control of perpetual sunlight, made us rich; and it seems to me, that we ought to be willing that he should hold one-quarter interest in this invention.", "speaker": "Albin Hamilton", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "the President", "addressee_in_char_list": false}
