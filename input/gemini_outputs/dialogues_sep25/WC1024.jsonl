Poor Mr. Wallis had his great pro- jects, an' perhaps if he 'd lived longer he 'd have made a record; but when he died he 'd failed all up, owing to that patent corn- sheller he'd put everything into, and, as you know, I had to get along 'most any way I could for the next few years. Life was very disappointing with Mr. Wallis, but he meant well, an' used to be an amiable person to dwell with, until his temper got spoilt mak- in' so many hopes an' havin' 'em turn out failures.

You know you lived in what we call the Wells house then, and I felt it would n't be an intrusion, we was such near neighbors.

{"utterance": "They used to say about town that Mr. Wallis went to an' fro like a mail-coach an' brought nothin' to pass. He ought to have had a better chance than he did in this little neighborhood. You see, he had ex- cellent ideas, but he never 'd learned the machinist's trade, and there was somethin' the matter with every model he contrived. I used to be real narrow-minded when he talked about moving 'way up to Lowell, or some o' them places; I hated to think of leaving my folks; and now I see that I never done right by him. His ideas was good. I know once he was on a jury, and there was a man stopping to the tavern where he was, near the court house, a man that traveled for a firm to Lowell; and they engaged in talk, an' Mr. Wallis let out some o' his notions an' contrivances, an' he said that man would n't hardly stop to eat, he was so interested, an' said he 'd look for a chance for him up to Lowell. It all sounded so well that I kind of begun to think about goin' myself. Mr. Wallis said we'd close the house here, and go an' board through the winter. But he never heard a word from him, and the disappointment was one he never got over. I think of it now different from what I did then. I often used to be kind of disapproving to Mr. Wallis; but there, he used to be always tellin' over his great projects. Somebody told me once that a man by the same name of the one he met while he was to court had got some patents for the very things Mr. Wallis used to be workin' over; but 't was after he died, an' I don't know's 't was in him to ever really set things up so other folks could ha' seen their value. His machines always used to work kind of rickety, but folks used to come from all round to see 'em; they was curiosities if they wa'n't nothin' else, an' gave him a name.", "speaker": "Mrs. Bickford", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Miss Pendexter", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

He had no sort of a business turn, but he was well meanin', Mr. Wallis was, an' full o' divertin' talk; they used to call him very good company. I see now that he never had no proper chance.

I don't see now how I ever did get along them next few years without him; but there, I always managed to keep a pig, an' sister Eliza gave me my potatoes, and I made out somehow. I could dig me a few greens, you know, in spring, and then 't would come strawberry-time, and other berries a-follow- in' on. I was always decent to go to meet- in' till within the last six months, an' then I went in bad weather, when folks wouldn't notice; but 't was a rainy summer, an' I managed to get considerable preachin' after all.

'T was a relief at first after Mr. Wallis's being so fluent; but Mr. Wallis was splendid company for winter evenings, 't would be eight o'clock before you knew it. I didn't use to listen to it all, but he had a great deal of information. Mr. Bick- ford was dreadful dignified; I used to be sort of meechin' with him along at the first, for fear he'd disapprove of me; but I found out 't wa'n't no need; he was always just that way, an' done everything by rule an' measure. He had n't the mind of my other husbands, but he was a very dignified ap- pearing man; he used 'most always to sleep in the evenin's, Mr. Bickford did.", "speaker": "Mrs. Bickford", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Miss Pendexter", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Folks said we was as pretty a couple as ever come into church; we was both dark, with black eyes an' a good deal o' color, you would n't expect it to see me now.

He didn't favor his folks, they all had hay-colored hair and was faded-looking, ex- cept his mother; they was alike, and looked alike, an' set everything by each other. He was just the kind of strong, hearty young man that goes right off if they get a fever. We was just settled on a little farm, an' he'd have done well if he'd had time; ast it was, he left debts. He had a hasty tem- per, that was his great fault, but Albert had a lovely voice to sing; they said there wa'n't no such tenor voice in this part o' the State. I could hear him singin' to himself right out in the field a-ploughin' or hoein', an' he did n't know it half o' the time, no more 'n a common bird would.
