You found me lying in the road down yonder, after a stupid accident that might have happened to any other careless tramp, and which scarcely gave me a claim to a bed in the county hospital, much less under this kindly roof. It was not my fault, as you know, that all this did not come out sooner; but while it does n't lessen your generosity, it does n't lessen my debt, and although I cannot hope to ever repay you, I can at least keep the score from running on.

Yet you all know that's Bob Rushbrook's style - he ain't here, because he 's full of some other plan or improvements and it's like him to start suthin' of this kind, give it its aim and purpose, and then stand aside to let somebody else run it for him.\nThere ain't no man livin' ez hez, so to speak, more fast horses ready saddled for riding, and more fast men ready spurred to ride 'em, - whether to win his races or run his errands. There ain't no man livin' ez knows better how to make other men's games his, or his game seem to be other men's. And from Jack Somers smilin' over there, ez knows where to get the best wine that Bob pays for, and knows how to run this yer show for Bob, at Bob's expense we're all contented. Ladies and gentlemen, we 're all contented. We stand, so to speak, on the cards he's dealt us. What may be his little game, it ain't for us to say; but whatever it is, we're in it. Gentlemen and ladies, we'll drink Bob's health!", "speaker": "a gentleman from Siskyou", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "the company", "addressee_in_char_list": false}

{"utterance": "She would n't, nor would you, if you had gone into the parlor as Miss Nevil would have done.\nBut look here! If that's the reason why you did n't bring her, send for her at once; my coachman can take a card from you; the brougham's all ready to fetch her, and there you are. She'll see only you and me.", "speaker": "Mr. Robert Rushbrook", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mr. Leyton", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "That won't do, Leyton. One or the other interview is unnecessary; it wastes time, and is n't business. Better have her present, even if she don't say a word.", "speaker": "Mr. Robert Rushbrook", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mr. Leyton", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Yes, but not in this matter; it's about Somers. You know he's been very attentive to her ever since her uncle left her here to recruit her health, and I think she fancies him. Well, although she's independent and her own mistress, as you know, Mrs. Leyton and I are somewhat responsible for her acquaintance with Somand for that matter so are you; and as my wife thinks it means a marriage, we ought to know something more positive about Somers's prospects. Now, all we really know is that he 's a great friend of yours; that you trust a good deal to him; ers, that he manages your social affairs; that you treat him as a son or nephew, and it's generally believed that he 's as good as provided for by you- eh? Did you speak?", "speaker": "Mr. Leyton", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mr. Robert Rushbrook", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

I employ him: that's his advertisement, recommendation, and credit. Now, on the strength of this, as you say, Miss Nevil is willing to invest in him; I don't see what more can be done.", "speaker": "Mr. Robert Rushbrook", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mr. Leyton", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "Leyton, you don't know Miss Nevil.\nWhatever that girl undertakes she's weighed fully, and goes through with.
