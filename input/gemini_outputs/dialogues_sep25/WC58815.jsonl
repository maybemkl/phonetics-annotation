He is accustomed to his old traditional task-master, and I doubt if he will work fairly for any other \u2014 particu-larly for those who don't understand him. Don't mistake me: I don't propose to go back to the whip; to that brutal institution, the irresponsible overseer; to the buying and selling, and separation of the family, nor any of the old wrongs; but I propose to make the old master our overseer, and responsible to us. He is not a fool, and has already learned that it is more profitable to pay wages to his old slaves and have the power of dismissal, like any other employer, than be obliged, under the old system of en-forced labor and life servitude, to undergo the cost of maintaining incompetence and idleness. The old sentiment of slave-own-ing has disappeared before natural common-sense and selfishness. I am satisfied that by some such process as this utilizing of the old master and the new freedom we will be better able to cultivate our lands than by buying up their estates, and setting the old owners adrift, with a little money in their pockets, as an idle, discontented class to revive old political dogmas, and foment new issues, or perhaps set up a dangerous opposi-tion to us.'", "speaker": "Colonel Courtland", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Cyrus Drummond", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

You know what the feeling is here already? You know what happened at the last election at Coolidgeville-how the whites wouldn't let the niggers go to the polls and the jolly row that was kicked up over it?

I only thought, if she was going to get herself into trouble on account of that Frenchman, you might talk to her she'd listen to you, because she'd know you only did it out of business reasons. And they're really business reasons, you know. I suppose you don't think much of my business capacity, colonel, and you would n't go much on my judgment especially now; but I've been here longer than you and I don't like the looks of things here. There's some devilment plotting among those rascals. They're only awaiting an opportunity; a single flash would be enough to set them in a blaze, even if the fire was n't lit and smouldering already like a spark in a bale of cotton.

Ye see the duel took place just over the bluff there behind ye and they allowed that Marion had struck away north for Mendocino to take ship there. For after overhaulin' his second's boat, they found out that they had come away from Saucelito alone.

Well, I went, and what do y'u think? He told me he was gettin' up an American Fishin' Company, and wanted me to take charge of a first-class schooner on shares.

With that he laughs, says he didn't want any better friends than me, but that I must be livin' in the backwoods not to know that Wynyard Marion had escaped, and was then at sea on his way to Mexico or Central America. Then we agreed to terms, and the long and short of it is, Mollie, that I'm to have the schooner with a hundred and fifty dollars a month, and ten per cent. shares after a year!
