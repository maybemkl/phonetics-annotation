When it became known in the neighborhood that I had determined to join General Jackson and serve as a soldier you boys proposed to go with me. I agreed, with a condition, and that condition was that we should organize ourselves into a company, elect a captain, and march to Camp Jackson under his command, not go there like a parcel of school-boys or a flock of sheep and be sent home again for our pains. You liked the notion, and we made a fair bargain. I was ready to serve under anybody you might choose for captain. I didn't ask you to elect me, but you did it. You voted for me, every one of you, and made me Captain. From that moment I have been responsible for everything.\nyou \"I lead you and provide necessary food. I plan everything and am responsible for everything. If misbehave as you go through the country I shall be held to blame and I shall be to blame.\nBut not a man of you shall misbehave.
