In the second place, asposel [supposing] he did talk to that Polish piece of disturbance. Vell, what of it? It is all over with the world, isn't it? The mourner's prayer is to be said after it, I declare! A married man stood talking to a girl! Just think of it! May no greater evil befall any Yiddish daughter.

Come, Mr. Podkovnik, you know you are a sensible man! I have always thought you one-you may ask my husband. Really you ought to be ashamed of yourself. A prohibition upon me if I could ever have believed it of you. Do you think a stylish girl would make you a better wife? If you do, you are grievously mis-taken. What are they good for, the hussies? To darken the life of a husband? That, I admit, they are really great hands at.
