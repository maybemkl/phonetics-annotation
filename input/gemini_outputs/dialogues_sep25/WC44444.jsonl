Never mind the consequences to yourself at such a moment. I assure you there will be none.

She was disappointed at your return from Sacramento, where, I have been told, she intended you to remain until you left the country; and since your return have seen you but twice. I may be wrong.

The fact of the matter is this: Sir\nRobert Mainwaring, the father of the young fellow you've\ngot in your house, is one of our directors and largest share-\nholders, and I can tell you-if you don't suspect it already\n--you've been lucky, Bradley-deucedly lucky-to have\nhad him in your house, and to have rendered him a service.\nHe's the heir to one of the largest landed estates in\nhis county, one of the oldest county families, and will\nstep into the title some day.
