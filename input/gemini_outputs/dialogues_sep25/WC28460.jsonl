{"utterance": "\u201cMY DEAR UNCLE, you have had a great\ndeal of trouble with me ever since I came into your\ncare, and I wish, with all my heart, I had been more\nof a comfort to you than I have ever been. It is only\nfair to myself to tell you, though, that I have meant to\nbe. For these three years past, I have been working\nday and night to get a little money of my own to lay\nout in such improvements as I think would make the\nold farm worth working, and I had hoped next year to\ncome back and settle down on it, and take the trouble\noff your hands.\nBut I've got to tell you something that you will not\nlike to hear any more than I like to tell you, and I have\nput off telling you as long as it was honest. The fact\nis, Uncle Humphrey, I am going into the army. I\ncan't stand it any longer. I stood by in the Spring and\nsaw all the men going off, and I said to myself, 'there\nare plenty without me, and there is plenty for me to do\nat home.' It was harder to stay than to go then, for\npeople did not know what they were about after that\nnews from Sumter, and were only wild to get at the\nSoutherners' throats that instant; they did not know\nhow many miles, and how many months lay between\nthem and what they wanted to get at then, but they\nknow now. And I know; and I am going now because\nI know, and because I am sure I am not going for the\nhurrah and glory of the thing; and the more yearning\nI have for home and the old life and the old place, the\nmore I mean to go, and the surer I am, I am doing\nright to go. And I know you are not the one to put a\nstraw before me if I see it so; and if you were a young\nman, Uncle Humphrey, you would see it so too. You\nwould feel, it was like standing by and seeing your\nmother struck, or worse than that, like looking on with-\nout a word, when ruffians had their hands upon your\nsister. In fine, it has come to that, that I could not.\nrespect myself if I held back, and that I could not feel\nI had a claim to the respect of the men and women\nwhose respect I care to have, if I did not give up my\npleasure and my prospects in the world, and my life, if\nthere is need of it, to my country in such a time as this.\nI should never expect a blessing on anything I did, if I\nworked for myself and looked after my own interest,\nwhile the country that I have held by all my life, while\nholding by it cost me nothing, was going to pieces in my\nvery sight. It has been my boast and pride everywhere\nI've been, the best country that a man ever claimed,\nand the cleanest flag that ever floated; and you would\nnot think me half a man, if I should just find out I\ndid not owe her anything.\nWho, all, from Titherly, have enlisted? Tell those\nthat have not gone already, they had better join my\ncompany: a dozen or so of Titherly men together would\nmake us feel as if the old place were doing something\nfor the Union. But we'll talk that all over when I\ncome up next week to say good-bye. I wish you had\nsome sons of your own, Uncle Humphrey, and then\nyou would not mind my going. But you see, if we all\ngo at it with a will, we shall make short work of it, and\nI shall be back the sooner with a clear conscience; and\nwe shall have something to yarn about over the fire\nwhen the nights are long and cold.\nYour affectionate nephew,\nLOUIS SOUTTER.\u201d", "speaker": "Louis Soutter", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Humphrey", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

I have begun to think I have not much place in the world except among the hard and practical. Friendship brought me here, friend-ship for this man against whom I have been warning you. Good heavens!

Truly, most truly, I do assure you, it was nothing of-of jealousy, no lingering thought of what has passed that prompted this. You would have reason to despise me if it had been; but as a brother who fears for his sister's happiness, as an honest man who sees a woman endangered by snares she does not see, I have spoken to you now. Frank, if you had been the merest stranger to me, I must have spoken, I must have warned you of the precipice you stand upon. I know Cyril Thorndyke; this is not his first folly.

There are honest men, men in your own sphere of life who no doubt will seek you, and who are far more worthy of you than he can ever be, and who will make you incalculably happier.

It was understood between Mr. Bell and myself, and I believe Mr. Soutter, that on the 6th of January, the subject should be revived, and the pre-liminaries settled for a meeting as soon after as was possible. I had an interview with Mr. Soutter last evening, but, owing to the lateness of the hour was not . able to communicate the result of it to Mr. Bell, intend-ing to see him at an early hour this morning.

Fully aware of the delicacy of my position, I am yet unable to persuade myself that I should be justified in perilling my life in such an encounter, and thereby sacrificing the happiness of one who has become dearer to me than my life. When I made the arrangement, it was different. Since then, new ties have bound me, new duties have devolved upon me; the happiness of another is committed to my hands, and I sacrifice my own impulses and the de-mands of honor, and yield to the claims of affection. I leave it to you to explain this to my adversary, and to convince him of the struggle that it has cost me to relinquish the revenge I had promised to myself. It will not, perhaps, surprise you, that guided by similar motives, I have just despatched my resignation to my commanding officer. I am resolved henceforth to live. solely to watch over the happiness of one who has generously given up all for me.\nI sincerely trust that no efforts to interfere with our plans may be made; they will be utterly thrown away, as, before this reaches you, our marriage will be con-summated, and we shall be on board a Liverpool packet, sailing at 9 o'clock.\nWith sincere thanks to my entertainers, and to you, for your recent services, and many regrets for the man-ner in which I am compelled to terminate my visit,\nI am obediently yours,\nBARNWELL BELL.", "speaker": "Bell", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mr. Rosenbaum", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Oh, how I have tried to persuade myself it was a sin to make him suffer so, to send him into the world disappointed and un-happy, when perhaps I could have led him right, and brought him, through his love to me, to the love that now he cannot understand! Frank, it was so hard to give him up! He is so noble, he is so nearly right, and he loves me so! You don't know what it was to have to answer him when he argued, to resist him when he pleaded! But I was frightened when I found how naturally I fell into believing what he told me to be-lieve, and being led by him in everything. I saw how foolish the hope was that I could lead him into what he has resisted all his life. It would be killing my faith and kindling none in him. It would be sinning for him, and not saving him.\nNow, since I have given him up, I can pray for him; if I had clung to him, I could not have prayed against him long!

It seems to me I cannot go\nwithout one good-bye look. It may be so long too-\nwell, it was my own fault, and I deserve it!\nIt seems a long while to wait, till to-morrow morn-\ning, for my answer. Let it be a kind one, Frank. Re-\nmember how long I have been your lover. Forget all\nbut that. It will almost kill me to know you do not\ncare for me. Try to care for me-promise to love me\u2014\ndon't send me off without any hope! There's nobody\nelse cares for you half as much, nobody whose love\nmeans anything compared with mine!\nKeep this picture, Frank, and send me yours some\nday. I do not think there is anything in the world I\nwould not give for it to-night. Shall I ever have a\nright to it? Heaven knows I'd serve faithfully and long\nenough to get the right even to your shadow!\nGood-bye. God bless you always!
