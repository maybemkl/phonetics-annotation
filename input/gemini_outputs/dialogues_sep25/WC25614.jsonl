Please believe that not malicious intentions but a sincere love for the young lady in question, who is Miss Alida Craig, an artist whose studio is in the Sherburne Building, prompts me to write you.

{"utterance": "It is better to hurt your vanity and mine than to go on and find that we have made a terrible mistake ; you know that we all have two sides to our natures. I don't think that you have ever quite realized the other side of mine. You have appealed to what is best in me, fostered it, brought it out ; but the other side is there, and lately it has come upper- most. I love power and fame and glory ; and just as years ago I walked out of my home without a pang, and left it to go on the stage, so, now that my stage life must come to an end, I cannot settle down to the dull round that you call society in JS\"ew York ; I must have more power and position than you can give me. I can leave you as easily as I took that other step, to have what I most desire in my new life. Love you !", "speaker": "Margaret", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Philip Herford", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "Margaret, my dear, I do not think you quite mean that being my wife wouldn't somewhat palliate the dulness of New York society. I don't know exactly what you mean, except that you have taken some jealous freak about Miss Craig. As you say, my dear, we all have two sides to our natures, and I can scarcely think that one so generous-hearted as yourself would think it the worst side of mine that I befriended a little, helpless, hard-working girl, whose chief attrac- tion, when I first met her, was that she reminded me vaguely of you.", "speaker": "Philip Herford", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Margaret", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "We may talk all day, Philip, but it cannot change the fact that I am tired of you, and that, to tell the truth, you are tired of me. As long as I thought you adored me, I fancied myself indis- pensable ; you see even in me there remains a vestige of the eternally feminine unnecessary sacrifice. When I heard of your devotion to Miss Craig I saw clearly that I had worn out my charmingly aesthetic but hard- ly human passion for you. Do you think that my heart, which has beat to the admiration of thousands, would be content with the perfunctory atten- tions of a husband who had wearied of me as a lover?", "speaker": "Margaret", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Philip Herford", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Tea ! concoctions of every- thing in the world that is calculated to shatter the nerves. Dorothy, whatever form of enjoyment your mother wishes to take for announcing your engagement, don't let it be a tea. I've been to three announce- ment teas this afternoon such jams ! Eeally, I can't remember whether Mabel Hawkins, in light blue, is going to marry her cousin who is in the army, or whether it is Louise Pome- roy.
