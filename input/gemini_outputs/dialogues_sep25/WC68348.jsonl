I have a great plenty of money from my last quarter's allowance, as I have only needed to spend a dollar and forty-five cents. Mr. Brown thinks I should come back fresher to my studies for a little rest; though I do not feel the need of it, and am glad of every day's new chance of learning.\nI hope you will excuse me, Mrs. Legrange, if it is too bold for me to say, but I do wish you could talk with Mr.\nBrown a little; he is so high in all his ideas, and seems to feel so strong about all the troubles of this world, and puts what a man ought to live for so much above the way he has to live!\nI took the liberty of talking with him about you, and about the great trouble I had helped to bring upon you; and what he said was first-rate, though I cannot tell it again.\nI felt ever so much better about my own doing wrong, and I could not help wishing you could hear what he said about you.\nThis place is a great resort for invalids, and people who like to be retired.
