Well, I was getting along all right; but she had a fellow coming to see her, an old fellow from town with a big pile. I had seen him once or twice before, and I took it into my head that she was liking him. I got to cutting up about it, and the first thing I knew she had sent me flying.

He 'would go in there,' and he 'wished to know who I was,' etc. I just pulled out my old pistol and shoved it up under his nose. You ought to have seen him! A keg of powder could not have set it off, but it looked like a cannon. Then I began to lecture him on the sin of persecuting a poor girl like he was doing-an old thing with a dyed mustache like him. You never heard such a lecture in your life. I preached like the doctor. Presently he said he would go back to the hotel, he was catching cold. I told him no, I could not let him go back just yet, but that I had some whiskey. He said he never touched whiskey.

They were the finest sleigh team you ever saw, and I let 'em go. You never heard a man pray so in all your life. When we got back it was about half-past eleven, and he was as mellow as an apple. I put him to bed, and went down to the doctor's. The lights were still burning in the parlor, and I walked in. Miss Lizzie was sitting before the fire with her little red shoes on the fender and her furs on a chair, pretending to read. I told her she had just as well take off those geranium leaves and put out those lights; that her old beau with his dyed mustache was in bed drunk, and his team had had all the moonlight driving they could stand that night. Whoop! but she was mad. She never spoke to me till I went back there; but she never spoke to him again at all. He went home next day, and died soon afterwards.
