See here, old man, the Lord knows I hate to say a word that may sound unkind to a fellow who has stood by me through thick and thin as you have, I wouldn t do it, Blakey, if I didn t think so d d much of you. I ve no idea of diplomacy. I can t beat round the bush ; but my opinion is just this : Granger called on every officer of the regiment except you and me. He never came near us last summer, though he was often here in the post. The night you sought his quarters to get help for old Bryan you were knocked senseless at his very door, and you had reason to think him responsible for the assault. So far from sending a courteous reply to your letter, he insults you ; says you perfectly well knew he could have nothing to do with the matter, because he was absent at the time, otherwise you wouldn t have presumed to visit his house. It is as blackguardly an affront as I ever heard of; and when I call upon him for the only reparation possible, he threatens us with charges of provoking a duel ; then he comes here and attempts to see you, and I head him off and, with Truscott for a witness, tell him in the language of the church catechism that he is a thief and a liar. You know perfectly well that no tongue in all this neighborhood was so virulent against us last summer as his. You know that he is the fountain spring of every bit of mean scandal concerning any officer that is put in circulation hereabouts. You know perfectly well that, when our fellows got back from the long, hard campaign, and those farewell dinners were given in town, and there was a good deal of fun and frolic, it was that fellow who came up here to Atherton, and went to the general s staff and to the general himself, I m told, and filled their ears with everything he had heard about one man after another. You know well that he never comes out to this post but that he has something discreditable to tell of some body or other from Sanders, Laramie, Sidney, or Fet terman whom he has seen at train-time in town. You know well that it was his evidence and persecution that drove poor Moulton out of the service, and that lie started the row that killed Jimmy Cramer right here at this post. You know well that half those Black Hills outfits are supplied with odds and ends of government stores that never were bought at public auction. Ask any one of those men where he got those things, and he will grin and wink, and stick his tongue in his cheek. They are sold by Granger s peo ple and Granger knows it, and it was because Moulton knew it and Cramer was catching on that he downed them. He has wealth and influence. He has a dozen men in his employ who will swear to anything he tells them, no doubt; but, all the same, he s an unmitigated cad. He had to write that letter to you after the run away. He s smart enough to know that public senti ment would be hard against him if he didn t, he begs you to accept his best thanks for so inestimable a ser vice and to let by-gones be by-gones, but what does it amount to? Does he explain the assault? Does he retract or apologize for the insult in the other note? jSot a bit of it !

Yet the  moment Major Granger came out here and took charge  at the depot, this fellow Brooks, or Howell, turned up  again, looking sober, but seedy. And damn me I beg  your pardon, sir if lie didn t get a good position right  off. He could have kept it, too, but for drink. And  when he drank he would talk and say all sorts of queer  things. He used to brag that Granger would make\n  him chief clerk any day he chose to ask; he wouldn t  dare refuse him ; for if he did he could have the old  man cashiered. He had clerked under him in New  Orleans, he said, during the war, and knew all about  his cotton business and steamboat contracts, whatever  they were. But last year he was drinking so hard  Granger had to get rid of him, and a shooting scrape  the fellow got into in town settled the business. It  was a fair enough fight, I reckon ; but the other man  was killed, and Brooks, or Howell, was shot so bad  that they thought he d die sure ; and his friends some  of this very gang, I reckon got him out of town, and  it was given out that he did die and was buried at a  ranch over towards the Cache la Poudre. I know  they told Granger so, and we all believed it, and the  next we knew a sergeant came in here who had been  stationed at the post seven years ago, and said Brooks  was serving in the d Infantry under the name of  Howell, over in California ; and then that very com  pany was transferred over here to Fort Steele, and the  next I knew was the night of the theatre here, and as  we were going home afterwards up to the ranch my  driver told me of the row down at the stables, and said  that Brooks was there drunk, and that he had picked  a fight with Granger s new coachman, and that Captain  Truscott had clapped him in the guard-house as a  deserter, recognized by Sergeant Carmody.
