Besides this, I would dig under the houses of the\nchurch and rob them of their treasures.\nThus I grew proud and haughty, thinking of my riches\nand spoils, and would no longer be cook unto my brethren.\nSo I put forth to sea in a new boat of tanned hide. But I\nfirst emptied my house of its treasures and filled my new\nvessel therewith. When I set sail the sea was calm, but\ngreat winds arose and drove me into mid-ocean, far\nbeyond sight of land, and there my boat stood still,\nmoving not.\nAs I looked about me, I beheld a man sitting upon a\nwave, who inquired of me whither I was bound. And he\ntold me I should be sorrowful and full of terror if I knew\nthe band that surrounded me; for a crowd of demons\nencircled me on every side because of my covetousness\nand my pride, my haughtiness, thefts, and other evil\ndeeds. Then he told me that my boat should remain\nmotionless until I did his will; and his will was that I\nshould fling all my treasures into the sea.\nSo I flung all into the waters save a small wooden\ncup. Then he gave me whey-water and seven cakes,\nand bade me go whither wind and wave carried me. I\nminded his words, and following the will of my boat, was\nfinally landed upon this crag.

On the third day the otter brought\nme the salmon again and another otter brought a piece\nof flaming firewood, and set it down and blew with its\nbreath, so that the fire blazed up. Thereon I cooked\nthe fish, and have lived on such food for another seven\nyears. And at the end of that time the fish supply\nceased and I fasted again for the space of three days.\nThen on the third noon half a wheaten cake and a piece\nof fish were cast up and a cup of good liquor came to\nme.
