I swear it  startled me a second, and then I saw it was just  the end of a clothes-line, and I had sense enough  to grab it, strength enough to hang on, and then  yell for help. Something heavy, something human,  was struggling at the other end, far under the ice,  and something told me it was Shoshonee. You  know the rest.
