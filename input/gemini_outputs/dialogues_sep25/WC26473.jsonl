Workin' at it in od times by and large, sometimes afore sun-up and sometimes after sundown, and all the time keeping up a day's work on the clame for a show to the boys, I emassed a honist fortun in 2 years of 50,000 dolers and still am. But it will be askd by the incredjulos Reeder How did you never let out anything to Injian Spring, and How did you get rid of your yeald? Mister Ford, the Anser is I took it twist a month on hossback over to La Port and sent it by express to a bank in Sacramento, givin' the name of Daubigny, witch no one in La Port took for me.

There is one of the sweetest old ladies there that I ever met the perfection of old-time courtliness with all the motherishness of a German woman. She was very kind to me, and, as she had no daughter of her own, I think she treated me as if I was one. At least, I can imagine how one would feel to her, and what a woman like that could make of any girl. You laugh, Mr. Hathaway, you don't understand - but you don't know what an advantage it would be to a girl to have a mother like that, and know that she could fall back on her and hold her own against anybody.

He had followed her from remote lands, dumbly worshiping her, building in his foolish brain an air- castle of happiness, which by reason of her magic power she could always see plainly in his eyes. And one day, beguiling him in the depths of the forest, she led him to a fair-seeming castle, and, bidding him enter its portals, offered to show him a realization of his dream.

{"utterance": "Yes, I wonder Mr. Rushbrook don't look at it in that way. It is a shame that all these pretty things\u2014and you know they are really good and valuable should n't show what they are. But I suppose everybody here accepts the fact that this man simply buys them because they are valuable, and nobody interferes, and is content to humor him, laugh at him, and feel superior.

Come, Grace, no New York or Philadelphia airs, here! Consider your uncle's interests with this capitalist, to say nothing of ours. Because you 're a millionaire and have been accustomed to riches from your birth, don't turn up your nose at our unpampered appetites.

{"utterance": "Perfectly. Our friend from Siskyou over there appreciates that p\u00e2t\u00e9 which he cannot name as well as I do. Rushbrook himself is the only exception, yet I fancy that even his simplicity and regularity in feeding is as much a matter of business with him as any defect in his earlier education. In his eyes, his chef's greatest qualification is his promptness and fertility. Have you noticed that ornament before you? It bears your initials, you see. It was conceived and executed since you arrived \u2014 rather, I should say, since it was known that you would honor us with your company. The greatest difficulty encountered was to find out what your initials were.", "speaker": "Jack Somers", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Grace Nevil", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "She would n't, nor would you, if you had gone into the parlor as Miss Nevil would have done. But look here!

{"utterance": "Yes, but not in this matter; it's about Somers. You know he's been very attentive to her ever since her uncle left her here to recruit her health, and I think she fancies him. Well, although she's independ- ent and her own mistress, as you know, Mrs. Leyton and I are somewhat responsible for her acquaintance with Somers, - and for that matter so are you; and as my wife thinks it means a marriage, we ought to know something more positive about Somers's prospects. Now, all we really know is that he's a great friend of yours; that you trust a good deal to him; that he manages your social affairs; that you treat him as a son or nephew, and it's generally believed that he's as good as provided for by you - eh?

{"utterance": "No, of you. Come, Rushbrook, don't pretend you don't know that Miss Nevil is a great partisan of yours, swears by you, says you 're misunderstood by people, and, what's infernally odd in a woman who don't belong to the class you fancy, don't talk of your habits. That's why she wants to consult you about Somers, I suppose, and that's why, knowing you might influence her, I came here first to warn you.", "speaker": "Charley Leyton", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Robert Rushbrook", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

But come, James has been for five minutes discreetly waiting outside the door to tell us dinner is ready, and the coast clear of all other com- pany. But look here, you 're through your talk, I suppose; perhaps you'd rather we'd dine with the Signora and the others than alone?", "speaker": "Robert Rushbrook", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Charley Leyton", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Nor would I tell it to you, only I cannot bear that you should think that I had anything to do with this wretched inquisition into Mr. Somers's prospects. Knowing as well as you do how per- fectly independent I am, you would think it strange, would n't you?
