Look at your mother, boy; see what a woman may be; see what she was to your father, what she is to me, to you, to every one that knows her.

He has only himself to thank for it. When you get to college they'll want you to smoke, and you'll want to, just for idleness and good fellowship.\nNow, before you begin, just calculate what it'll cost you.\nYou can't get a good cigar under ten cents, and your smoker wants three a day, at the least. There go thirty cents a day, two dollars and ten cents a week, or a hundred and nine dollars and twenty cents a year. Take the next ten years at that rate, and you can invest over a thousand dollars in tobacco smoke. That thousand dollars, invested in a savings bank, would give a permanent income of sixty dollars a year, a handy thing, as you'll find, just as you are beginning life.

Take your Prayer-Book and read her solemn service, and see what those marriage vows are that you think of taking. Are these to be taken lightly and unadvisedly?\nI recollect, when I was a young girl, we used to read \"Sir Charles Grandison,\" and one passage in the model Harriet Byron's letters I copied, into my scrap-book. Speaking of one who had proposed to her, she says: \"He seems to want the mind that I would have the man blessed with that I am to vow to love and honor. I purpose whenever I marry to make a very good, and even dutiful wife; must I not vow obedience, and shall I break my marriage vow?\nI would not, therefore, on any consideration, marry a man whose want of knowledge might make me stagger in the performance of my duty to him; who would, perhaps, command from caprice or want of understanding what I think unreasonable to be complied with.\"", "speaker": "Mrs. Courtney", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Eva Van Arsdel", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "MY DEAR FRIEND, -I am glad you have written as you have to Eva. It is perfectly inexplicable to me that a girl of her general strength of character can be so undecided. Eva has been deteriorating ever since she came from Europe. This fashionable life is to mind and body just like a hotbed to tender plants in summer, it wilts everything down. Eva was a good scholar and I had great hopes of her. She had a warm heart; she has really high and noble aspirations, but for two or three years past she has done nothing but run down her health and fritter away her mind on trifles. She is not half the girl she was at 183 school, either mentally or physically, and I am grieved and Her only chance of escape and indignant at the waste.\nsalvation is to marry a true man.\nBut when people set out as a first requisite that the man must be rich, how many are the chances of finding that?\nThe rich men of America are either rich men's sons who, from all I have seen of them, are poor trash enough, or business men, who have made wealth by their own exertions. But how few there are who make money who do not sacrifice their spiritual and nobler natures to do it?\nHow few with whom the making of money is not the beginning, middle, and end of life, and how little can such men do to uphold and elevate the moral nature of a wife!\nMr. Sydney is a man, heart, soul, and strength, interested in that mighty game of chance and skill by which, in America, money is made. He is a railroad king\u2014a prince of stocks a man going with a forty-thousand steam power through New York waters. He wants a wife - a brilliant, attractive, showy, dressy wife, to keep his house and ornament his home; and he is at Eva's feet, because she is, on the whole, the belle of his circle. He chooses en Grand Seigneur, and undoubtedly he is as much in love with her as such a kind of man can be. But, in fact, he knows nothing about Eva; he does not even know enough to know the dangers of marrying such a woman. With all her fire, and all her softness, all her restless enthusiasms, her longings and aspirations and inconsistencies, what could he do with her? The man who marries Eva ought to know her better than she knows herself, but this man never would know her if they lived together an age. He has no traits by which to estimate her, and the very best result of the marriage will be a mutual laisser aller of two people who agree not to quarrel, and to go their own separate ways, he to his world, and she to hers; and this sort of thing is what is called in our times a good marriage.\nI am out of patience with Eva for her very virtues. It is her instinct to want to please and to comply, and because mamma and Aunt Maria have set their hearts on this match, and because she is empty-hearted and tired, and ennuyeuse, she has no strength to stand up for herself.\nHer very conscientiousness weakens her; she doubts, but does not decide. She has just enough of everything in her nature to get her into trouble, and not enough to get her out. A phrenologist told her she needed destructiveness. Well, she does. The pain-giving power is a most necessary part of a well-organized human being. Nobody can ever do anything without the courage to be disagreeable at times, which I have plenty of. They do not try to control me, or enslave me. Why? Because I made my declaration of independence, and planted my guns, and got ready for war. This is dreadfully unamiable, but it did the thing; it secured peace; I am let alone. I am allowed my freedom, but everybody interferes with Eva. She is conquered territory has no rights that anybody is bound to respect. It provokes me.\nAs to the religious part of your letter, dear friend, I thank you for it. I cannot see things as you do, however.\nTo me it appears that in our day everything has got to be brought to the simple test of, What good does it do? If baptism, confirmation, and eucharist make unworldly, selfdenying, self-sacrificing people just as certainly as petuniaseed make petunias, why, then, nobody will have any doubt of their necessity, and the Church will have its throngs.\nI don't see now that they do. Go into a fashionable party I have been in, and watch the girls, and see if you can tell who have been baptized and confirmed, and who have not.\nThe first Christians carried Christianity over all the pomp and power of the world simply by the unworldly life they lived. Nobody doubted where the true Church was in those days. Christians were a set of people like nobody 185 else in the world, and whenever and wherever and by whatever means that kind of character that they had is created, it will have power.\nI like the Episcopal Church, but I cannot call it the church till I see evidences that it answers practically the purpose of a church better than any other.\nFor my part I go to hear a dreadfully heretical preacher on Sunday, who lectures in a black coat in a hall, simply because he talks to me on points of duty which I am anxious to hear discussed. Eva, poor child, wears down her health and strength with night after night in society, and spends all her money on dress; doing no earthly thing for any living creature, except in the pleasure-giving way, like a bird or a flower, and then is shocked and worried about me because I read scientific works on Sunday.\nI make conscience of good health, early hours, thick shoes, and mental and bodily drill, and subjection. Please God, I mean to do something worthy a Christian woman before I die, and to open a path through which weaker women shall walk out of this morass of fashion-slavery and subjection where they flounder now. I take for my motto that sentence from one of Dr. Johnson's allegories you once read to us: \"No life pleasing to God that is not useful to man. 99 I hope, my dear friend, I shall keep the spirit of Christ, though I wander from the letter. Such words as you have spoken to me, however, can never come amiss. Perhaps when I am old and wiser, like many another self-confident wanderer, I may be glad to come back to my mother's house, and then, perhaps, I shall be a stiff little Churchwoman. At all events I shall always be your loving and grateful pupil.", "speaker": "Ida Van Arsdel", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mrs. Courtney", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "MY DEAR BELLE, Thanks for your kind letter with all its congratulations and inquiries, for though as yet I have no occasion for congratulation, and nothing to answer to inquiry, I appreciate these all the same.\nI am No, Belle, the \"old sixpence\" is not gone yet, you will have to keep to your friend a while longer.\nnot engaged, and you have full liberty to contradict that report everywhere and anywhere.\nMr. Sydney is, of course, very polite, and very devoted, very much a friend of the family and all that, but I am not engaged to him, and you need never believe any such thing of me till you hear it directly, under my own hand and seal.\nThere have been a lot of engagements in our set lately.\nLottie Trevillian is going to marry Sim Carrington, and Bessie Somers has at last decided to take old Watkins though he is twenty-five years older than she; and then there's Cousin Maria Elmore has just turned a splendid affair with young Livingstone, really the most brilliant match of the winter. I am positively ashamed of myself, under these circumstances, to be sitting still, and unable to report progress. My old infelicity in making up my mind seems to haunt me, and I dare say I shall live to be a dreadful example.\nBy the bye, I have had a curious sort of an adventure lately. You know when I was up at Englewood visiting you last summer, I was just raving over those sonnets on Italy, which appeared in the \"Milky Way\" over the signature of \"X.\" You remember those verses on \"Fra Angelico\" and the \"Campanile,\" don't you? Well, I have found out who this \"X\" is. It's a Mr. Henderson that is now in New York, engaged on the staff of the \"Great Democracy.' We girls have noticed him once or twice walking with Jim Fellows (you remember Jim); Jim says he is a perfect hermit, devoted to study and writing, and never goes into society. Well, was n't it odd that the fates should have thrown this hermit just in my way?\n\u2015 187 The other morning I came over from Brooklyn, where I had been spending three days with Sophia, and when I got into the car whom should I see but this identical Mr. Henderson right opposite to me. I took a quiet note of him, between whiles thinking of one or two lines in his sonnet.\nHe is nice-looking, manly, that is, and has fine dark eyes.\nWell, do you know, the most provoking thing, when I came to pay my fare I found that I had no tickets nor small change what could have possessed me to come so I can't imagine, and mamma makes it all the worse by saying it's just like me. However, he interposed and arranged it for me in the nicest and quietest way in the world. I was going up to call at Jennings', the other side of the Astor House, to see about my laces, but by the time we got there, there came on such a rain as was perfectly dreadful. My dear, it was one of those shocking affairs peculiar to New York, which really come down by the bucketful, and I had nothing for it but to cross Broadway as quick as I could to catch a Fifth Avenue omnibus, and let my lace go till a more convenient season.\nWell, as I stepped out into the storm, who should I find quite beside me but this gentleman, with his umbrella over my head.\nI could see at the moment that it had one of those quaint handles that they carve in Dieppe.\nWe were among cars, and policemen, and trampling horses, and so on, but he got me safe into an up-town omnibus, and I felt so much obliged to him.\nI supposed, of course, that there it might end, but, would you believe it, quite to my surprise, he got into the omnibus too! \"After all,\" I said to myself, \"perhaps his route lies up town like mine.\" He was n't in the least presuming, and sat there very quietly, only saying, \"Permit me, as he passed up a ticket for me when the fare was to be paid, so saving me that odious necessity of making change with my great awkward bill. I was mortified enough but knowing who it was, had a sort of internal hope that one day I could apologize and make it all right, for, my dear, I determined on the spot that we would invite him to our receptions, and get Jim Fellows to make him come.\nI think there is no test of a gentleman like the manner in which he does a favor for a stranger lady whom the fates cast upon his protection. So many would be insufferably presuming and assuming- he was just right, so quiet, so simple, so unpretentious, yet so considerate.\nHe rode on very quietly till we were opposite our house, and then was on duty again with his umbrella, up to the very door of the house, and holding it over me while we were waiting. I could n't help expressing my thanks, and asking him to walk in; but he excused himself, giving his card, and saying he would be happy to call and inquire after my health, etc.; and I gave him mine, with our Wednesday receptions on it, and told him how pleased mamma would be to have him call. It was all I could do to avoid calling him by his name, and letting him see how much I knew about him; but I did n't. It was rather awkward, was n't it?\nJim Now, I wonder if he will call on Wednesdays.\nFellows says he is so shy, and never goes out; and you know if there is anything that can't be had, that is the thing one is wild to get; so mamma and all of us are quite excited, and wondering if he will come. Mamma is all anxiety to apologize, and all that, for the trouble I have given him.\nIt's rather funny, is n't it an adventure in prosaic old New York? I dare say, now, he has forgotten all about it, and never will think of coming into such a trifling set as we girls are.

There is not, for the most part, sensibility enough left to enable them to read through or enter into the purport of one book in a hundred; yet, for all this, you do observe here and there in the columns of our best papers carefully studied and seriously written critiques on books; these are hopeful signs.

Does not Jesus Christ say, 'Gather up the fragments that nothing be lost' He said\n-289 it about a basket of bread; would n't he say it still more about the fragments of the human soul?

{"utterance": "\"Yes, look at the children,\" said he. \"The little things have learned already, from their mother, to care for each other, and to care for their father. In their little childish way, they love and bear with him just as she does. The boy came to me this afternoon and said, 'Father's got another crazy spell.' Already he has a delicacy in his very mode of speaking; and he does n't say his father is drunk, but that he is crazy, as he is. And then he and the little girl are so fatherly and motherly with the baby. Now, I say, all this growth of virtue around sin and sorrow is something to be revered. The fact is,\" he added, \"the day for separating the tares from the wheat hasn't come yet. And it seems to me that the moral discipline of bearing with evil, patiently, is a great deal better and more ennobling than the most vigorous assertion of one's personal rights. I can see a great deal of suffering in that family from poor Pat's weakness and wickedness, but I also see most noble virtues growing up, even in these children, from the straits to which they are put. And as to poor Pat himself, he comes out of his demon-baptism penitent and humble, and more anxious to please than ever.\nIt is really affecting to see with what zeal he serves me, when I have brought him through a 'drunk.' And yet I know that it will have to be gone over, and over, and over again. Sometimes it seems to me he is like the earth after a thunder-shower fresher and clearer than he was before.\nAnd I am quite of Mrs. Molloy's mind. there is too much good in Pat to have him swept off into the gutter for the bad; and so, as God gives her grace to suffer, let her suffer. And if I can bear one little end of her cross, I will. If she does not save him in this life, she'll save him from sinking lower in demonism. She may only keep his head above water till he gets past the gates of death, and then, perhaps, in the next life, he will appear to be saved by just that much which she has done in keeping him up.\"", "speaker": "Bolton", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Harry Henderson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Shall I go to Stewart's and buy me a new suit of Willow Green, or gird up the loins of my mind and go through Darwin like a man, and look out all the terms in the dictionary and come out the other side a strong-minded female? or shall I go and join the Sisters of St. John, and wear a great white cape and gray gown, and have all the world say I did it because I could n't get Wat Sydney (for that's exactly what they would say), or what shall I do?

If I had taken one taste, just one, I should have been utterly worthless and unreliable for weeks. Yet Hestermann could not under345 stand this; nobody can, except one who has been through my bitter experience. One sip would flash to the brain like fire, and then, all fear, all care, all conscience would be gone, and not one glass, but a dozen would be inevitable, and then you might have to look for me in some of those dens to which the possessed of the devil flee when the fit is on them, and where they rave and tear and cut themselves with stones till the madness is worn out.

That young men in all the inexperience and thoughtlessness of youth should be beguiled into just such a fatality; that there should be a possibility that they could be blighted by just such a doom, and yet that song, and poetry, and social illusion, and society customs should all be thrown around courses which excite and develop this fatality! What opera is complete without its drinking chorus? I remember when it used to be my forte to sing drinking songs; so the world goes!

I am a Christian and a man of honor in my sane moments, but let me tell you, one glass of wine would make me a liar on this subject. I should lie, and intrigue, and deceive the very elect, to get at the miserable completion of the aroused fury, and there are times when 347 I am so excited that I fear I may take that first irrevocable step; it is a horror, a nightmare, a temptation of the Devil, for that there is a devil, men with my experience know; but there is a kind of safety in having a friend of a steady pulse with me who knows all.

{"utterance": "And I will recommend a taking title, cried Jim Fellows, who came in as we were talking, and stood behind my chair. Let us have HENDERSON'S HORROR; OR, THE MYSTERY OF THE BLOODY LATCH-KEY. There's a title to take with the reflecting public! The readers of serials are generally girls from twelve to twenty, and they read them with their back hair down, lounging on the bed, just before a nap after dinner, and there must be enough blood and thunder, and murder and adultery and mystery in them to keep the dear creatures reading at least half an hour.", "speaker": "Jim Fellows", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Harry Henderson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

She is regularly running on five serial stories, and among them all they keep her nicely a-going; and she tells me that the case is the same with all the girls in her set. The knowledge of the world and of human nature that the pretty creatures get in this way is something quite astounding. Nell is at present deeply interested in a fair lady who connives with her chambermaid to pass off her illegitimate child upon her husband as his own; and we have lying and false swearing-I say nothing of all other kinds of interesting things \u2014 on every page. Of course this is written as a moral lesson, and interspersed with pious reflections to teach girls as how they had n't oughter do so and so.

But, you see, the Hestermanns, while they give me carte blanche as to means to run it, expect of course that it is to be run in the approved popular grooves that the dear thoughtless ten million prefer. The people who lounge on beds after dinner are our audience, and there must be nothing wiser nor stronger than they can apprehend between sleeping and waking. We talk to a blas\u00e9, hurried, unreflecting, indolent generation, who want emotion and don't care for reason. Something sharp and spicy, something pungent and stinging no matter what or whence. And now as they want this sort of thing, 349 why not give it to them? Are there no other condiments for seasoning stories besides intrigues, lies, murders, and adulteries?

That girl is a brick! Did n't use to think so, but she's sublime! The way she takes things is so confounded sensible and steady! I respect her there's not a bit of nonsense about her now 'd better believe.

There is n't to be any my or thy. Everybody is to have everything just the minute they happen to want it, and everybody else is to let 'em. Marriage is an old effete institution, a relic of barbarous ages. There is to be no my of husband and wife, and no my of children. The State is to raise all the children as they do turnips in great institutions, and they are to belong to everybody.
