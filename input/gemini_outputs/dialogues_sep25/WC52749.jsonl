You will not, I think, dissent from my proposition, that a man who resolutely stems the tide of existing disadvantages, is unflinching in self-denial, unmoved by the lures or ridicule of the world around, sedulously improving whatever gifts he may possess, with a standard of honor and virtue not lower than the Gospel has established, such a man, I say, not only is entitled to, but commands and receives the esteem and respect of his fellows, and may be pro- nounced worthy the imitation of a prince, much less the Hon.

And I incline to the opinion, that the perception he mani- fests of genius in others, by his bent of study and choice of authors, has too much of a kindred principle not to have ties of relationship which the family of that royal lineage will not wholly disdain. But, my dear Everard, it is not his intellectual gifts, nor his taste for literature, nor his ambition that I am com- mending: it is his steadfast purpose in the employment of time, his courage in the maintenance of religious observance amid countervailing obstacles, and the con- sequent virtue and purity of his daily life.

He seldom sought companionship in our rollicking set; and if, by chance, thrown among us, was so evidently out of place as to be almost amusing. But, in truth, though we dubbed him Prig and Parson, and thought him righteous overmuch, yet the genuine respect he elicited always forbade the least approach to ridicule. And yet his calm face, as you call it, could be moved to anger, as I can testify.

But what would\nyou have from a poor maiden, amid the bewildering\nsuccession of ball, masque, opera, and ballet, in her\nfirst season, and not yet inured to its glittering maze ?\nQuietude and repose unknown, a few hours snatched\nfrom morning dawn for fitful slumber, perchance to\nwaken for a deje\u00fbner at Richmond, or canter in the\nPark, and thus in the whirlpool of lace, flowers, and\nplumes, the glare of lights and din of flattering tongues,\nhow shall the scattered thoughts obey a summons to\nindite a rational epistle?\nVainly would your imagination, my Carlotta, en-\ndeavor to reflect a life, contrasting so entirely with the\nsolemn repose of our beautiful Venice, rising from the\nsea in mysterious silence, unbroken save by the meas-\nured dip of the gondolier's oar to the murmured can-\nzonetta from Tasso,--and in place of the thronging\ncrowds that sway the streets of this great northern\nmetropolis, a solitary Capuchin or gray Franciscan,\nwith noiseless step, gliding along the narrow foot-\npath, or round the corner of some old palace,\u2014for the\nflaunting modern equipage and its prancing steeds, the\nancient gondola, scarce ruffling the Adriatic in its still,\nslow march, like a dream of the past, or a mute at the\nfuneral of Venetian glory.\nFrom London to Merindale, the transition to com-\nparative quiet is refreshing to the weary mind and\nframe. And yet I do not deny that the season had\nits charms for me. At nineteen, the heart is not shut\nto the allurement of Madam Pleasure, with her siren\nsong and robes of divers colors. Moreover, in Leices-\nter Square, there were others beside her votaries, and\nI sometimes had a glimpse of reason and instruction\nwhich, I must honestly confess, in that aforesaid\nwhirlpool, was rare and transient. Our last week in\nLondon was, perforce, quiet enough, because of an\nuntoward accident that befell my uncle, disabling him\nfrom walking, and causing such pain that, from incli-\nation as well as duty, I remained at home to share\nthe office of nurse with Isabel, deputing Egmont and\nhis friend Faulkner to present apologies and report to\nme the stereotyped bombast of regret for a vanished\nstar from the hemisphere of fashion,' etc. Meanwhile,\nI must not omit to tell you of the ray of romance that\nentered into the reality of that unfortunate sprain.\n\u0410 young gentleman-(now I can see as in a mirror\nyour interest excited)\u2014a young gentleman, near him\nat the instant, interposed his stalwart arm, and saved\nhim from a fall whose consequences might have been\nserious, accompanied him home, assisted him into\nthe very hall itself, and then disappeared like a vision\nof the night, unseen by us, fully absorbed by the\nshock of beholding our beloved one in such a state,\nhis name unknown to all, to my uncle's great annoy-\nance, at such seeming neglect in failing to acknowl-\nedge bis obligation. But I am confident my instinct\nwill discover him, albeit, without an inkling to guide\nme; and Isabel and I have already indulged sundry\nimaginings in regard to this phantom knight, our sculp-\ntured model being of course an Apollo in faultless\nsymmetry and feature, chivalrous in port, voice of\ndeep melody, and every virtue under the sun. Whether\nfate will ever permit us to identify said dreams is at\nbest but doubtful.\n We returned to the castle for the Christmas holi.\ndays, and, with a goodly company of guests, passed\nthe time merrily till I'welfth Night among mistletoe\nboughs and yule-logs and rustic serenades from the\npeasantry that came for their dole. Isabel, as lady\nof the castle, and I, as next of kin, danced down a\nreel in the hall with a bumpkin apiece, to my ex-\ncessive fatigue. But it is a usage of olden times,\ntherefore I wound up my Italian languor to its needed\npitch, and maintained the semblance of happy exhila-\nration with as little hypocrisy as the intense ennui\nwithin allowed. My young cousin is growing daily more\nlovely, and by next season, when she is to be presented,\nthe bud will be unfolded into the beauteous rose, the\nfairest, I predict, of the London parterre. And I opine\nthere is more than one cavalier that has eyes as well\nas myself; but she is timid as a fawn, and rarely affords\nopportunity for avowed admiration. It will require\nthe crucible of a London winter to fit her for such\nhomage. We shall again, ere long, exchange the far-\nstretching park and broad domain of the castle for the\nnarrower precincts of Merindale House, with its foggy\natmosphere and fashionable coteries, till Easter, when\nspring will be donning her robe of green and calling\nus to celebrate the Queen of Feasts amid the tender\nleaves and budding flowerets with which she is decking\nall nature. I shall hail it with delight, for, in truth, I\nam weary of a life of fashion, its conventionalities and\nhollow fascinations, and feel regret at the prospect of\nbeing again plunged into the heartless throng. But\nI must needs pause, Egmont summons me to join a\nskating-party to the pond near the lodge. Entre nous,\nthe thought, to my southern blood, does not excite\nany special hilarity, but I cannot decline to accompany\nour guests.

I am inflexibly determined to\novercome this tendency to irresolution at once, and\ninitiate the reform by obedience to my mother's wise\ncounsel, to live more at Knowlton than heretofore, and\noccupy myself with the interests and well-being of\nthose for whose care a large estate has made me re-\nsponsible.\n As to the late dereliction, the Christmas I should\nhave spent here was passed at Merindale Castle.\nEgmont's solicitations I could have withstood, but\nthere was irresistible allurement in the dark eyes of the\nbrilliant Lucia, and still more in the dawning loveliness\nof the young Isabel, who, meanwhile, still wraps her-\nself in her virgin modesty as a valley-lily in its green\nJeaf. But this reserve will doubtless thaw before the\npublic gaze, to which her debut, next winter, will neces-\nsarily expose her. Egmont seems quite \u00e9pris of his\nbeautiful cousin, regardless of her betrothal to some\nItalian Conte from childhood, while the fair Venetian\nreceives his devoirs, as well as those of her whole train\nof admirers, with the mien of a princess permitting the\ndue homage of her liegemen. She sings divinely,\nnothing can surpass the rich sweetness of her voice in\nher own mellifluous accents, which she says constitute\nthe natural language of music. None can deny the\nflowing harmony of the Italian, and for music, fash-\nion and taste have elevated it above all others; but in\nforce of expression and true sentiment I prefer our old\nSaxon.\n This recalls your query concerning Bolton, our\nci-devant college-mate. I know little of him since he\nleft those classic halls. After a few months on the\ncontinent as compagnon de voyage to Mr. Stepney, who\nwas ordered on a tour by his physicians, he repaired\nto London, and became a student of the Temple; and\nwe may imagine him threading the musty folios and\ndry codes of jurisprudence with as much zeal and zest\nas we would the intricacies of a flowery labyrinth.\nYou know his characteristic perseverance in aim, and\ninvulnerability to all seduction of divergence therefrom,\nand you remember that he, more than once, won the\nlaurel from me by the exercise of this very quality, with\nwhich I am not endowed by nature, and, therefore, suffer\nthe double temptation of prospective pleasure and tem-\nperament. Bolton, however, always bore his honors\nwith such quiet modesty that, after the first mortification\nof defeat, I yielded with the best grace I could com-\nmand, not a little mollified by the recollection that my\nname and station had been wrought out and established\nby a long line of ancestry, and could not be affected by\nthe gain or loss of a university prize, while my oppo-\nnent required the aid of the talent and indomitable\nenergy he assuredly possesses, to lay the foundation\nof whatever rank or fame his genius may carve for\nhim. In pursuance of my plan of reform, and as be-\ncomes my representative position in the county, I, to-\nday, accompany my mother on a visit to some\nthe neighboring gentry, preparatory, no doubt, to sun-\ndry bumdrum dinners among dowagers and spinsters\nand landed proprietors, enlivened by discussions on\nthe hackneyed topics of the day,\u2014the corn-laws, French\ntreaty, my lady's poodle, or merits of Bulwer's last\nnovel.

{"utterance": "It was in the thirteenth century that one of my an-\ncestors, styled in Norman French, Seaton Vere de\nFolkner, when scarcely past the era of manhood, left\nhis home and country for the Crusades. He was not\nthe head of the house, but a younger brother, the idol\nof his mother's heart, and endeared to all by his gentle\nrefinement and studious devotion. Grave, but not taci-\nturn, by day, a recluse in some rural haunt without\nother society than the immortal dead in their works,\nhe would, at its close, re-enter the halls of his fathers,\nto charm the assembled guests with the rich stores\nof his learned research, not for applause, or for what\nseemed alike indifferent, to win the approving smile\nof beauty, but as if in rapt inspiration from the\ngreat minds in wbich he had just been revelling. A\nrigid devotee, and versed in all the poetic lore of the\nCrusades, and the heroic achievements of the gallant\nknights that made that great romance of the Middle\nAges illustrious, when the last flickering devotion of\nCatholic Europe again marshalled a mighty host, with\nSaint Louis as the great captain and motive spirit, to\ndeliver, by sword and lance, from the Infidel, the sepul-\nchre of the Prince of Peace, the exalted imagination of\nthe young de Folkner caught the flame, and naught\ncould extinguish his burning zeal to enrol himself\namong the soldiers of the Cross.\n\u201cTwo years elapsed, and he was heard of at Malta,\npreparing, by fast and vigil, to enter the noble Order\nof the Knights of St. John. Another year, and through\nan incoberent epistle from his foster-brother, Godfrey,\nwho had followed his fortunes in capacity of esquire,\nPhilippe de Folkner was summoned in haste, ere his\nwaning life should expire, with no kindred beside the\ndying-bed to weep his early death. The mother had\nnot long survived the parting with her youngest-born,\nand slept in the stately mausoleum of the ancient line.\nSpeedily as intervening space rendered possible, Sir\n71\na\nPhilippe journeyed to the spot, imagination picturing,\nas he went, the lifeless form of one who had, a few\nyears since, moved among them a model of grace and\nmanly dignity, whose exploits in field and tourna-\nment, as knight and crusader, he had hoped would\nshed lustre on his house and country. Arrived at\nMalta, he stands beside the lowly pallet of the long-\nabsent and tenderly cherished brother. He still lived,\nbut raving in the wild extravagance of brain fever, his\nhead closely shorn of the brown locks his mother had\nso proudly entwined, and so emaciated and changed\nthat even that tender mother had not known her child.\nTo Sir Philippe's queries, Godfrey replied in evident\nconstraint, praying that he would waive for the present\nall solution of this dreadful visitation, and the strange\nwords the sufferer uttered in his delirium. By fresh\nmedical advice, increase of cc\u0159forts, and the richest\ncordials wealth could procure, after twenty-four hours\nthe fever subsided, leaving him weak as infancy, but\ncalm and rational. When his brother's presence was\ncautiously communicated, he had well-nigh relapsed\ninto frenzy; but by degrees it seemed to soothe and\ncomfort him, though powerless to dispel the deep\ngloom of his brow or unseal the lips so eloquent in\nthe past. At length, as day after day rolled on,\nbringing strength to his frame, Sir Philippe determined\nto solve this mystery, and with kindness, but with the\nauthority considered in that age the lawful attribute\nof the chief of the house, he elicited the following\nnarrative:\n\" By the conspicuous sanctity of bis daily life, his\nextraordinary zeal in maintaining those combats with\n6\n6\n1\nthe world, the flesh, and the devil,' literally enjoined\nby the forms of the brotherhood, Seaton De Folkner,\nnow no longer immersed in the varied lays of trouba-\ndours or historic annals, his studies strictly limited to\nthe diffuse and stern minutia of monastic law and\nsuperstitious tradition, was admitted to fellowship in\nthe renowned Order of St. John, before attaining the\nmaturity that might in others have been deemed indis-\npensable to stability of resolution. While panting for\nthe hour that would bear their martial hosts from the\nrocky isle to do battle for recovery of the Holy Sepul-\nchre, when he should, by mighty deeds of valor, win\nhis spurs, he was wont to give unwearied observance\nto the rule imposing offices in behalf of the sick and\ndestitute.' In his fanatical zeal, he would repair to\nValetta, through the burning highways, his feet, all\nunused to aught harder than the moss of English\nKnowlton in his rambles, or the soft product of\nTurkish looms within its balls, shod but with sandals.\n\u201cOne summer's day, entering a squalid hut, a\nscene presented itself destined color his future\nlife and mournfully change its sequel. The hut con-\ntained but two beings, a woman ghastly with disease\nand penury, and what seemed to him an angel de-\nscended from Paradise, standing beside her. His\nframe, weakened by fasting and penance, his mind in-\nbued with belief in miraculous visions, legends of\nsaints, and supernatural cures, he did not at all doubt\nthat he was in presence of a celestial messenger from\nthe skies; and powerless to avert his gaze from the\nangelic figure before him, he stood, bowed as if in\nadoration, his dark cassock outlined in the light of the\n73\ndoor-way, and cap of the Order, half military, half\nmonkish, thrown back as he entered, developing the at-\ntenuated but classic features of the English noble, and\nhand uplifted as if to bless, transfixed by the beatific\napparition before him. The angel, as he thought, was\nattired in a flowing robe of gray, black cross on the\nbreast, and veil of pure white falling on each side of\nthe face to the feet. No color tinged the pale cheek,\nrendering more striking the eyes, black and of un-\nearthly brilliancy, and the regular pencilling of the lash\nand eyebrow. It was not strange that such orbs should\nhave been deemed more meet for seraphs than for the\ndaughters of men. But the trance of the young\nKnight of St. John was dispelled by the voice of the\nsuffering occupant of the poor bed bidding him enter,\nand the consequent change of position in the bending\nform beside her, and he awoke to behold, not a spirit\nfrom Paradise, but a creature of flesh and blood, in\nwhose costume he recognized a novice of the Order of\nGray Nuns from Spain, of which there was a convent\nnear by. In sweet, low lones, she spoke a few words\nto the object of her ministrations, and saying, as she\npassed, padre tu benedicion, vanished, when scarcely\nhad the Knight of St. John but partially recovered\nfrom his illusion, murmured, above her kneeling figure,\ndios te benediga, hija. Weeks rolled by, and he saw\nher no more, and if, amid the absorption of his calling,\nthe recollection of the incident sometimes mingled, it\nwas ever with the first conception of the beautiful\nvision as of no earthly mould. But fate, that so often\nappears to work its will by devious, unlooked-for\nchances, decreed they should again encounter. It was\n7\non the outskirts of Valetta, not far from the convent\nwalls, that Seaton De Folkner was moodily returning\nfrom one of his pious pilgrimages, when he heard a\nshriek of distress, and hastening to the spot, beheld a\nwoman struggling in the grasp of a bandit, who, at\nthe approach of aid, precipitately fled, releasing his\nfrightened captive, now fallen insensible to the ground.\nAgain was the angel of the hut before him, lying as\none dead, and mutely appealing to him for succor.\nLifting her light form from the earth, he chafed her\nhands and administered the medicaments he. bore in\nhis charitable rounds, and soon beheld, unclosing, those\ndark eyes he had supposed could only pertain to an\ninhabitant of the celestial world. She trembled vio-\nlently, as if still believing herself in the rude grasp of\nthe bold robber, and it needed many words of soothing\nassurance to calm the beating heart almost wild with\nterror. She strove to withdraw from his support, but\nthe shock was too recent; and more than an hour passed\nere her tottering steps enabled her to regain the outer\nlodge of the convent, when she disappeared from view.\nOut of the vivid interest of this brief hour sprung up\nin the virgin heart of the young Knight of St. John a\ngerm of new emotion, whose stormy tide neither\nsworn vows, nor stern rules, nor scourge of penance,\nnor invocation of saints could avail to stem. Her eyes\nscarce uplifted, and no words save a broken entreaty\nfor release, in melodious Castilian; while, on his side,\nconstrained to support her weakness, and in the same\ntongue solicit, in the eloquent flow of earlier days, that\nshe would await return of strength, and yet love, that\nbas no dial whereby to measure its growth, attained\n75\nwithin him a full mastery that should know no decline\nwhile life remained. Long after, was he rent by\nagonies of remorseful contrition, and rigid were the\nmortifications and penances with which he endeavored\nto purify his conscience from the accusations of invol-\nuntary sacrilege and sin of broken Vows, but such\nmemories seldom fade or die; and ofttimes would\nthere rise to his view the bold relief of that chiselled\nbeauty bis arm had succored and perforce sustained.\nThus did the conflict of contending passion rage fear-\nfully for months, till in one of the pilgrimages his rest-\nlessness made more urgent, he was passing the convent\nabout twilight, when a tolling bell announced a spirit\npassing away from earth. Struck by mysterious pre-\nsentiment, he bethought him of the hut where he had first\nbeheld the object of his sleeping and waking dreams,\nand hurrying thither, made almost inarticulate inquiry\nof its inmate respecting the knell even now sounding\nfaintly in the distance.\nAh, father!' she replied with sobs and tears, 'it\nis for the blessed Sister Inez your reverence remembers\nto have seen in my poor hovel last summer. Old Sis-\nter Ursula from the convent has but gone as your rev-\nerence entered, and she tells me the heavenly saint has\nbeen ailing since the day she was frightened on the\nroad to Valetta, and as Sister Ursula believes, by the\ndevil hin self, for who else would harm an angel like\nthat? She returned nearly fainting, and has seldom\n?\nleft her cell since that day. And Sister Ursula says\nthe dear saint spoke strange things in her delirium,\nand asked for penance as if the innocent lamb had ever\nsinned! Ah, if ever there was a pure spirit it was Sis-\n666\nter Inez, and now she is dying, and I shall never more\nlook upon her lovely face and hear her sweet words of\ncomfort !'\nTransfixed with a feeling of grief and despair, the\nyoung knight stood speechless while the weeping pau-\nper continued; then abruptly quitting the hut, regained\nhis dwelling, and it was after repeated paroxysms of\nfrenzy that his faithful esquire made the summons that\nbrought Sir Philippe to his bedside. The day suc-\nceeding his story, he demanded an interview with the\nGrand Master, and after confession, was, though offered\nabsolution for the sins of the heart, deposed from the\nHoly Order of St. John at his own desire. When en-\nabled to journey by slow degrees, he consented to re-\nturn to England, to die amid the shades of Knowlton,\non condition that he should never be required to dwell\nwithin its luxurious halls, but in a rude abode in the\nvalley that was once a favorite resort. He survived\ntwo years in the habitation before you, a melancholy\ndevotee, sternly observing all the austerities of penance\nand self-denial possible, and forbidding his sepulture in\nthe vaults of his forefathers, as one who had committed\nsacrilege and forfeited solemn vows, by permitting love\nto enter his beart. He was interred within the rude\nstructure that had witnessed the throes of his remorse\nand his untiring devotion. Hence, it is a spot pre-\nserved with sacred care by each succeeding generation,\nand the history of the lone hermit has ever constituted\na solemn tradition in the archives of Knowlton. The\nportrait of Seaton Vere de Folkner, as he was in his\nyouth, when the pride of his house and the happy stu-\ndent in the green bowers of his ancestral domains,\n77\nhangs in the west gallery, and may be known by the\nlong, dark locks that wave from his intellectual brow.\n\u201cAnd now, praying the forgiveness of my indulgent\naudience for the prolixity of my narrative, we will, if\nit be their pleasure, remount, in search of prospects less\nmournful in retrospect, and more modern in association.", "speaker": "Hon.

{"utterance": "Listen, cugina mia, listen to a brief history of my Venetian girlhood, brief indeed, if reckoned by its birthdays, but in interest and importance to me, fruitful as a patriarchal lifetime. My father, as you know, by no means contemplated entire expatriation from his native England at his marriage with an Italian lady, nor was it until after more than one test of her constitution to a climate so diverse from her own, that lie reluctantly yielded to the evidence of fatal effect if the experiment were persisted in, and determined on a residence in Italy, which his moderate fortunes as a younger son required should be secluded and unpretending. My earliest recollections are associated with a modest villa on the Brenta, not far from Venice, with its willows drooping to the flowery earth, a small lake at the back, and its flaunting little bark moored in the shade ; in front, the blue waves and many-colored sails. My mother's hereditary palace in Venice could not boast the frowning magnificence that distinguished the architectural grandeur of Palladio, but, nevertheless, with its rambling corridors, hollow-sounding halls, and tapestried chambers, betokened past greatness, and afforded a spacious and comfortable babitation for a winter's sojourn. A pretty ch\u00e5let in the cool recesses of the Friuli mountains was our retreat from the sum- n'er's heat and malaria. These transitions with returning seasons, gave new life to my frail and languid mother, but, alas! there is reason to fear, were not efficacious to avert disease from my father, whose frame evinced increasing enervation under an atmosphere devoid of the bracing gales of his northern home. On the shores of the Brenta where we dwelt side by side, in the old marble palace at Venice, or climbing the pic- turesque summits of Friuli, Stefano, but two years my senior, was my guide, my companion, inseparable, ever-chosen. On the lake, its quiet surface seldom dis- turbed by a ripple to affright us, as steersman in gay cap and black feather waving to the breeze, mingled with dark locks of a like raven hue, to my young eyes, a model of grace and symmetry; or seated beneath an arbor watching the idle sails along the Brenta, or shaded by the willow, plaiting cages of the slender wands for a chance bird astray from distant haunts, or weaving a collar of flowers for my greyhound; in Venice enacting tableaux devised from the voluptuous beauties of Titian, or the grim portrait of some Venetian grandee of the time of her doges which hung in sumptuous array in the long picture-gallery of his father's palace; or listening, delighted, to the gondolier as he sang the lament of Tasso in his captivity while gliding over the Adriatic Sea; or roaming, for unheeded hours, through the clefts or along the summits of Friuli, emu- lating the chamois browsing on the inaccessible cliffs above us, lingering till the Angelus from some far-off convent-tower should toll for mid-day, or till sunset should call forth the Ave Maria from a village church below, there was still Stefano by my side. Our in- structors were the same, excepting only the abstruse studies befitting his sex. Together, we admired the majestic vigor of Dante or loved the mellifluous verses of Petrarca; together, we read, with proud interest, of old Venetian glory when she sat a queen upon the waters, and wept for her decay and submission to the usurper. My father was his tutor in English, and opened to his understanding the genius of Shakspeare, of Chaucer, and of Milton. With the harp and Venetian lute we sang the soft melodies of Petrarca to his Laura, and the impassioned canzonette awoke no unholy emo- tion to sully our innocence. The betrotbal beside my father's death-bed was solemn, but found no dissent in our young hearts. Isabel, in that land of the sun, wbere nature develops her beauty in fond luxuriance, where art springs forth as if in rivalry of that perfect nature, amid the inspired music of song in a language seemingly the chosen vehicle of love, woman earlier learns its impassioned teachings than in the frigid con- ventionalities of a region where it unfolds slowly to the sunligbt, like the rose-bud wrapping itself closely in its mossy armor till tempted to expand by the warm touch of summer. At sixteen, the love that had grown with my strength was entire and absorbing, and the wail of sorrow that, for months after reaching England, re- fused to be comforted, was not wholly the requiem above my mother's tomb, separation from the living mingled deeply in its inconsolable lament. Since, I have lived on the memories of the past, without a cloud to shadow the happy future till the fatal hour of that dark, strange narrative repeated by Mr. Stanmore, at Knowlton. From that day, a blight has mildewed my peace with its doubt and suspicion, and my soul has been rent by alternate hopes and fears.

He came at once, and, at her request, occupied your seat, near enough to hear her whispered communication. It was to commend us both to his protection. She did not banish me from the room, but only to the farthest window, so that with no intention of being a listener, I could not but learn the purport of the conversation. Mamma spoke of our desolate state and reduced income, and obtained from him a promise to shield us from the misfortunes likely to befall us. And oh, Helen! my cousin most readily and eagerly gave this assurance. Part of the colloquy did not reach my ear, but I heard my mother say, in reply to a protestation most ardently expressed from the tone of voice, Then, I die happy in the hope at least that they will have a home at Bournlee.'

Must my whole being be plunged in darkness after basking in sunlight till it was steeped in happiness? Helen, I asked not, recked not, if there were a chord of response, but revelled in the intoxicating present as if there were no future,\u2014day by day looking to the morrow but as a reflecting mirror, with no menacing cloud to dim its lustre.

Katrine\ntaught me a nursery song about the Elfin King in\nthe gloaming,' that I still remember. But best of\nall was it to see the kye come home, and hear their\nbells tinkle in the distance.
