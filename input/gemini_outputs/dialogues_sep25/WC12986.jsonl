I knew if the shine-ball came out  and found me away from home that I would n't  be able to see what was going on, for the shine baU is so bright that it hurts my eyes.\n\n I wandered about among the trees, jumping  from one to the other, until finally I remembered  where a woodpecker had had a nest in a big pine  not far off. I had seen him hiding some acorns  there, and at night I used to go there and see  how they tasted, and I thought if I could get  there by the time the shine-baU came out I could  get a little rest. Well, I went to the pine and crawled into the woodpecker's nest. But it was  very uncomfortable, and had a bad smell. There  was no soft bed in it, such as I had at home, and  everything about it was rough. The door \u2014\nNow I don't think you ought to eat all the good  ones yourself and pick out the bad ones for me.\n Why, that last piece was black on one side.", "speaker": "Flit", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Buster John", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Up went the hawk again,  and I thought it would be best for me to stay  under the limb. But this did n't help me much.\n The hawk began to call her mate, and in a very  short time there were two of them sailing around.\n The biggest one came slowly down and lit on the  limb right over me. She leaned forward and  looked at me ; and of all the horrible creatures  you ever saw, she was the most horrible. She  breathed as loud as a 'possum snores.\n\n I came very near dropping from the limb. I  moved toward the body of the tree, and the  hawk moved after me and tried to reach me with  her hooked beak. I made a dash and went round  the body of the tree, and as I did so the hawk's  mate came swooping down. By this time the  other hawk was on the wing, and by the time I  darted on the other side she was ready to swoop.\n This would n't have lasted long. Some one came  along and said ' shoo ' to the hawks, and they flew  away, and then I felt that same somebody take  me from the tree more dead than alive.", "speaker": "Flit", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Sweetest Susan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
