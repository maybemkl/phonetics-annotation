But mother loved the  house, the fields, and every crooked tree. She was alone, and  so I staid with her. In the center of the village green stood  the square, white meeting-house, and near by the small cot tage where the pastor lived ; the minister's daughter, Mary,  was my promised wife. Mary was a slender little creature  with a profusion of pale flaxen hair, large, serious blue eyes,  and small, delicate features ; she was timid almost to a fault ;  her voice was low and gentle. She was not eighteen, and we  were to wait a year. The war came, and I volunteered, of  course, and marched away ; we wrote to each other often ;  my letters were full of the camp and skirmishes ; hers told of  the village, how the widow Brown had fallen ill, and how it  was feared that Squire Stafford's boys were lapsing into fcvil  ways. Then came the day when my regiment marched to  the field of its slaughter, and soon after our shattered remnant  went home. Mary cried over me, and came out every day to  the farmhouse with her bunches of violets ; she read aloud  to me from her good little books, and I used to lie and watch  her profile bending over the page, with the light falling on her  flaxen hair low down against the small, white throat. Then  my wound healed, and I went again, this time for three years ;  and Mary's father blessed me, and said that when peace came  he would call me son, but not before, for these were no times  for marrying or giving in marriage. He was a good man, a  red-hot abolitionist, and a roarinfg lion as regards temperance ;  but nature had made him so small in body that no one was  much frightened when he roared. I said that I went for three  years; but eight years have passed and I have never been  back to the village. First, mother died. Then Mary turned  false. I sold the farm by letter and lost the money three  months afterward in an unfortunate investment; my health  failed. Like many another Northern soldier, I remembered  the healing climate of the South ; its soft airs came back to  me when the snow lay deep on the fields and the sharp wind  whistled around the poor tavern where the moneyless, half crippled volunteer sat coughing by the fire. I applied for this  place and obtained it. That is all.", "speaker": "John Rodman", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Ward De Rosset", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
