{"utterance": "Balloons are used a good deal in war now, not so much for signaling as for observing the movements of the enemy, the size and disposition of his forces, and the fortifications and defenses that he has. Nearly all nations have a balloon system attached to their signal force, and they make the gas in the field, inflate the balloons, attach them to wagons, put men into them, and send them up a halfmile or mile, and keep the balloons moving by driving the teams attached to the wagon, thus giving the observers a better opportunity to make their observations and reducing the likelihood of the balloon's being pierced by shots. The men in the balloon communicate with those on the ground by telephones or signals, examine the enemy's lines and forces, make sketches and even maps, and often take photographs, and so get a good deal of valuable information.", "speaker": "Daniel Patterson", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Henry Wilkins", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Many of the men have business that they can not leave, others have families dependent upon them who would be left in want if the men should go at the low rate of pay which soldiers get, and there are many others who could not stand the physical examination which a man must pass before being able to enter the military service.

{"utterance": "Thirteen dollars per month does look like small pay, but it is the rate paid in the regular army, and even that is higher than is paid in most of the armies of the world. Of course, this sum is paid in addition to food, clothing, and quarters. The soldier has no expenses of living to provide for. He is furnished food, clothing, a place to live, medical treatment, and medicines when sick, so that he has little actual need for the necessities of life; and as the law provides that he may retire with three-quarter pay after thirty years of service and go to the Soldiers' Home at Washington to live after his retirement, he is sure of support for life if he determines to devote the active part of his career to the military service. Besides, he gets some extra pay if he re-enlists at the end of his first term, and an additional increase of pay for further re-enlistments.", "speaker": "Daniel Patterson", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Daniel Patterson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "Just the same. It is not supposed, of course, that a rate of thirteen dollars per month is a full compensation to the man who leaves his employment temporarily for war services; but patriotism and love of country lead men to offer their services in times of war, and they do so with the understanding that they are to be paid the same rates as those paid to the regular army, and have the privilege of returning to their business when the war shall have ended.", "speaker": "Daniel Patterson", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Daniel Patterson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

A general can not deliver his orders verbally to every man in his army; he must convey them to the men through the officers that are near to and in touch with him, and who are termed his staff.' The success of an army depends upon every member's moving in prompt compliance with the wishes of the man who plans the battle and determines what movements must be carried out; but as the men are scattered over the battlefield, out of range of his voice, and many of them out of his sight, and 55 perhaps, even miles away, he must communicate his plans through other officers whose duties are to convey the orders and see that they are carried out. Besides this, generals have many other duties, such as seeing that the men are properly drilled, clothed, and fed; that the camps are properly located, arranged, and kept in order; that the proper precautions are taken to prevent surprises by the enemy; that the men for scout duty are sent out to see what the enemy is doing, and that others on picket duty give warning of the approach of a hostile army or its scouts and spies. Intrenchments must be dug to enable a defense in case of attack; wood and water and supplies brought together for the use of the men in camp, and many other things of this kind done.", "speaker": "Daniel Patterson", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Daniel Patterson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

The army must be enlisted, made up into companies and regiments, clothed, brought together in camps, and drilled. And what is even more difficult and important is the necessity of providing them with camp equipage, arms and ammunition, and the artillery necessary to accompany them. It may be possible to drill men in a comparatively short time so that they can be handled in a crude way, but you can not make fighters of them in a day or a month. But it is more difficult to get food and clothing, arms and ammunition, and ordnance and medical supplies, which they must have, and without which they will be absolutely useless. Take the matter of ammunition alone. The President has called for one hundred and twenty-five thousand men in addition to the twenty-five thousand of the regular army. The providing of even one hundred rounds of ammunition each, for these one hundred and fifty thousand men, means fifteen million cartridges, and, of course, soldiers can not be sent into a campaign with only one hundred rounds of ammunition each.", "speaker": "Daniel Patterson", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Farmer Gordon", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Originally around' of ammunition was the powder, the wadding or greased cloth which went between the powder and round bullet or shot, and the percussion cap or priming with which the powder was ignited. It required these four distinct articles with which to load and fire a gun, and they formed a 'round' of ammunition, and if a soldier had one hundred sets of these he had one hundred 'rounds.'

{"utterance": "Because it is now definitely learned that Admiral Cervera with his fleet is in the harbor of Santiago. Hobson, by sinking the Merrimac in the channel, has bottled them up, and it is now necessary to 'invest' (as it is called) the city\u2014that is, to surround it with an army and capture it, since entrance into the harbor by our fleet is neither considered practicable nor wise.", "speaker": "Mr. Patterson", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "Well, now that the mail is off I can do so. Admiral Cervera's fleet left the 191 Cape Verde Islands about May 1st. For weeks no trace could be had of it. Whether it would sail for the coast of the United States and attack the great cities, sail to Puerto Rico and there establish a base of operations, or make for some port in Cuba, nobody could tell. Admiral Sampson was sent to Puerto Rico to head the Spaniard off if he should put in an appearance there, and after shelling the forts at the entrance of San Juan found that Cervera's fleet was certainly not in the harbor. He then returned to Tampa, where he was met by Commodore Schley. They then decided that Cervera would probably try to get into one of the two ports on the south shore of Cuba, Santiago or Cienfuegos, or make a run for Havana, and that the chances were that he would stop at Cienfuegos, since it lies right across the island from Havana and is connected with it by rail. So it was decided that one part of the great fleet composed of Sampson's and Schley's squadrons should go around the west end of the island and hunt for Cervera in Cienfuegos harbor, or at Santiago, if he should not be at Cienfuegos, and that the other should go around the eastern end and watch for his passage through the channel there. Sampson, of course, had a much greater distance to go, for the port from which they started was nearly opposite the western end of Cuba. When Schley arrived at Cienfuegos he found the harbor empty, but heard that Cervera was at Santiago, and sailing there he passed back and forth before the entrance of the harbor until his lookouts caught sight of some of the vessels within. Then he settled down to watch the mouth of the harbor, as a cat watches a mouse hole, and three days later Sampson arrived and assumed command of the fleet. Then was developed the plan of running the Merrimac into the channel and sinking her across it to prevent the escape of the fleet, a piece of heroism which has few equals in the history of naval warfare.", "speaker": "Mr. Patterson", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Since one half of the Spanish fleet has been destroyed at Manila, and the other half is bottled up in Santiago, the army is now to go to the latter place, capture the city, and compel the fleet in the harbor to surrender after its supplies shall have been exhausted, or sink it with land batteries?", "speaker": "Dan", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mr. Patterson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "To begin with,' he said, 'you must remember that when President McKinley's orders came to Commodore Dewey to \"capture or destroy the Spanish fleet,\" we were near Hong Kong, just off the coast of China, over six hundred miles from Manila. We sailed the next day, having with us the American Consul, who had been sent out of Manila by the Spanish, also some of the Filipinos who were familiar with the coast of the Philippines and the harbor of Manila. In four days we reached the coast, going first to Bolinao and Subig Bays to hunt for the Spanish fleet. Not finding them there, the commodore concluded they were in Manila Bay, and determined to follow them.'", "speaker": "Henry Wilkins", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "The American fleet,' he said, 'consisted of four modern steel cruisers-the Olympia, Boston, Baltimore, and Raleigh; two gunboats-the Concord and Petrel; and one revenue cutter, the McCulloch, all together carrying fifty-seven big guns, seventyfour rapid-firing and machine guns, and eighteen hundred men. The Spanish fleet consisted of three steel cruisers-the Reina Christina, the Isla de Luzon, and the Isla de Cuba; three iron cruisers-the Don Antonio de Ulloa, the Don Juan de Austria, and the Velasco; one wooden cruiser, the Castillo; five gunboats and two torpedo boats, all carrying fifty-two big guns and eighty-three rapid-firing and machine guns, and nineteen hundred and fifty men. Besides these, there were Spanish batteries on the shores at the entrance of the bottle-shaped harbor, and all along its shore up to some twenty miles from the mouth of the harbor, where Manila stands. We had heard that these batteries contained many fine modern cannon, and that the harbor was full of submarine mines and torpedoes which would make it almost impossible to enter it.'", "speaker": "Henry Wilkins", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "The moon was still shining,' he said, 'when we came in sight of the entrance to the harbor, and so we waited until it went down, and then, putting out all the lights, steamed as silently as the vessels could steam, straight for the entrance of the harbor. There were two islands in the entrance, and they were heavily fortified; yet we passed, apparently without attracting any attention, almost through the entrance until some sparks from one of the vessels caused the forts to fire a few shots, which were answered by a shot from our ships, but nothing more. We sailed seventeen miles up the harbor in the darkness, ex195 pecting every minute that the much-talked-of mines would explode beneath our vessels and probably destroy some of them. But there were no explosions. When we thought we were about opposite Manila we stopped and waited for daylight.", "speaker": "Henry Wilkins", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Manila,' he continued, is on the western side. of the bay. When daylight came we saw the Spanish fleet lying in front of the city and its batteries. Our fleet, led by the Olympia, the flagship, steamed past it near the eastern side of the bay, leaving at a safe and convenient spot our supply ships, which carried coal and ammunition. We then turned and in single file sailed past and in front of the Spanish fleet, every man at his post, the guns loaded and ready for firing. Then came shots from the forts, but the only answer our fleet made was to run up a line of signal flags, showing the code watchword, \"Remember the Maine!\" Steadily the ships moved forward, the shots from the land guns and vessels falling about them, but still no orders to fire. Then suddenly there came a terrific rumbling sound, and a geyser of mud and water shot up in front of the Baltimore, and directly another near the Raleigh, and we knew that we were among the mines.'", "speaker": "Henry Wilkins", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "And still no firing from the fleet?'", "speaker": "Henry Wilkins", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Still no firing. Signal flags went up on the Olympia, the flagship, saying: \"Hold your fire until close in,\" and our ships sailed on with shot falling on every side. At last, Commodore Dewey, who had been watching the line of vessels with his glass, conIcluded that the distance was no more than about five thousand yards, and up went the signal flag, \"Fire as convenient,\" and a roar of big guns answered from all the vessels.'", "speaker": "Henry Wilkins", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Then the fighting began when the vessels were about three miles apart?'", "speaker": "Henry Wilkins", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Yes, just about three miles,' he answered. 'Our vessels moved steadily forward along the front of the line of Spanish ships, reducing the distance to about two and a half miles, but pouring in a fire all the time, the big two-hundred-and-fifty-pound shells beginning to tear holes in the Spanish vessels, while their shells exploded so near ours that they smashed the rigging and bridge grating on the Olympia, near where Commodore Dewey stood, one shot passing entirely through the Baltimore, but hitting nobody. After our line of ships had passed the Spanish fleet they deliberately turned about and passed back in front of it again, pouring in another fire and damaging their ships, as we could see, considerably. Having passed a second time, they turned for a third passage in front of it, each time drawing a little nearer. Then came the most exciting moment up to that time, for as they turned for the third attack they saw Admiral Montojo's flagship, the Reina Christina, heading for that of Commodore Dewey, evidently for an encounter at close range, and perhaps intending to ram her. In an instant the guns of every one of our ships were trained on the Christina, and in a moment she was quivering under the stream of shot and shell that was being poured into her. Great holes opened in her side near the water line, her bridge was shot away, the guns began to be silenced, and the machinery disabled, and soon she made for the shore.", "speaker": "Henry Wilkins", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "About this time two little torpedo boats made a rush for our fleet, but the rapid-fire and machine guns gave them such a hailstorm of shot that they soon scurried away, leaving our ships to give their attention to the larger vessels of the Spaniards, which evidently were becoming badly damaged. This had gone on for two hours, and our fleet had passed in front of the Spanish vessels five times, pouring its fire into them each time, when orders were given to cease firing, and our fleet withdrew to the other side of the bay for breakfast.'", "speaker": "Henry Wilkins", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "For breakfast!' I could not help saying. 'Stop in the middle of a battle to eat breakfast.'", "speaker": "Henry Wilkins", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Yes,' he answered, with a laugh. I do not wonder at your astonishment. But there was good reason for it. The firing had so filled the air with smoke that we could not see even our own ships, while those of the enemy, which were about two miles and a half away, were still more difficult to distinguish. The fight had gone far enough to show that our guns and gunners were superior to those of the Spanish, and that we could afford to give the men a rest and their breakfast, let the smoke clear up, and start in again. Besides, our officers wanted to know how our ships. had stood the fight, how many men had been killed, and how the ammunition was holding out, for we had only a limited supply, and were a long distance from home. To their surprise, not a ship had been disabled and not a life lost. It was a most wonderful result, thus far.", "speaker": "Henry Wilkins", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "After three hours spent in breakfasting, renewing the supply of coal and ammunition, and putting everything in good order,' he continued, the fight was resumed at 10.45 A. M. The smoke had cleared away, and as we neared the Spanish vessels again we could see their crews busy trying to put out the fires which our shells had kindled in their ships, and getting their vessels in as good shape as they could in this brief time. It was decided by our officers that the Spanish vessels were so badly disabled that it was not necessary to keep our fleet in motion, as during the first attack, but that they would simply take the Spanish vessels one at a time and shoot them to death-destroy them. Before they could begin they saw Admiral Montojo transferring his flag from the Reina Christina to the Isla de Cuba. Then the Baltimore, taking the lead, sailed straight for the Reina Christina, which was still making some show of offensive firing, and when within less than two miles began to pour heavy shot and shell into her, assisted by other members of our fleet, with the result that she slowly crumbled away and finally exploded as a shell struck her magazine, killing and drowning many men, those who remained alive jumping into the water and swimming for shore, while the vessel quickly sank.", "speaker": "Henry Wilkins", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Then the Baltimore, Olympia, and Raleigh 199 turned their attention to the Don Juan de Austria, and for a few minutes they poured a stream of shot into her, the shells piercing her sides, wrecking her steering machinery and guns, and as they exploded destroying boilers and engines and fighting machinery, and the men who worked them. Suddenly there was a terrific roar which was heard above the continuous thunder of the guns, the decks of the Austria rose with a sheet of flame following them, and she settled quickly into the waters, the result of an explosion of her magazine. Then came the turn of the Velasco and Castillo, both of which suffered the same fate; then the others, one by one, until Admiral Montojo, seeing nothing left about him but burning and smoking wrecks, hauled down his flag and escaped to shore, the Isla de Cuba, his second flagship, going down a few minutes later, thus ending the battle.'", "speaker": "Henry Wilkins", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "No, the naval signaling system is entirely different from our own. The former has ten flags, one of which stands for figure 1, another for figure 2, and so on up to 9, and one for the zero. Then there is a code book, by which a given figure or combination of figures stands for a given order or sentence. Suppose that in this code book the number 1,397 stands for the order 'Get up steam at once and prepare to sail.' When the commander wants to transmit this order, he runs up the flag designated as 1, then No. 3, then No. 9, and then No. 7. The officer of the vessel for whom the message was intended replies with a special flag which means 'signal understood,' and the order is considered as transmitted, and duly received and acknowledged.", "speaker": "the sergeant", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Dan", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "Yes. The code of day and night signals used in the United States navy is contained in two books, the General Signal Book, and the Fleet Drill Book. The General Signal Book contains about seven thousand words and sentences arranged alphabetically, and regularly numbered, and is supplemented by about ten thousand words and eleven thousand names of places, all indicated by numbers. The Fleet Drill Book has all the necessary orders for fleet drill and tactical formation.

The semaphore consists of an upright frame or post, with a movable arm, or arms, that can be swung into various positions and make signals somewhat similar to those which you make in signaling with the flag in the army service.

Many of the harbors of these islands have a high rock or promontory on one side or the other of the entrance, and of course the chief fortification is built upon it; and when that is the case, it is naturally termed 'Castillo del Morro,' the castle of the promontory.

If this were attempted, there would be but few of the men left by the time the line reached the enemy's works.

The men lying in the valley there, waiting for the final dash, are, as you say, not in the sort of accurate line of battle that you had been accustomed to see in pictures; the companies and even regiments are intermingled, and the men are firing singly or in little squads as the case may be.

Those of us who were bound for San Juan kept straight ahead instead of turning to the right, and while you were lining yourselves up around Caney we were encamping along the road in the thick woods a short distance from San Juan.

{"utterance": "Yes. It is considered the duty of the artillery not only to begin a battle of that character, but to do it so thoroughly that the defenses will be destroyed or damaged, the artillery of the enemy silenced, and their troops so shaken by the fire that they will be less able to withstand an assault. This plan was followed both at El Caney and San Juan, but with only moderate success in either because the case, which our guns people had been able to bring up over these wretched roads were small and there were but few of them.
