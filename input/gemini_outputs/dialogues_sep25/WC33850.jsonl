She's very sensitive to the defects in her early education; but I made\nher understand that it was the heart more than the\nhead that I cared for. I dare say, Gracie, she'll fall\ninto all our little ways without really knowing; and\nyou, in point of fact, will be mistress of the house as\nmuch as you ever were.

She sent me off, yet she would not let me forget her. She would always write to me just enough to keep up hope and interest; and she knew for years that all my object in striving for fortune was to win her. At last, when a lucky stroke made me suddenly rich, and I came home to seek her, I found her married, - married, as she owns, without love, - married for wealth and ambition.  I don't justify myself, \u2014I don't pretend to; but when she met me with her. old smiles and her old charms, and told me she loved me still, it roused the very devil in me. I wanted revenge.

I always said that a woman had no need to have offers made her by a man she could not love, if she conducted herself properly; and I think the same is true in regard to men.

By your own account of the matter, you have been encouraging and keeping up a sort of silly, romantic excitement in her. It is worse than silly; it is sinful. It is trifling with her best interests in this life and the life to come. And I think you must know that, if you had treated her like an honest, plain-spoken brother or cousin, without any trumpery of gallantry or sentiment, things would have never got to be as they are.
