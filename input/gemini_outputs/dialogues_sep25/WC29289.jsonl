Well, my uncle always seemed fond of me, but he was a very passionate man, and in 1860, when I was about twenty, we had a quarrel about politics one day.\nHe had always been an 'old Federalist;' thought secession a great crime, and threatened, if I took any part in it, that he would disinherit me. Well, you know I am not patient, and I did not like to be threatened. I answered hotly, left Gaymount, and heard, in 1862, that my uncle had died suddenly, and left the bulk of his estate to my cousin, Arthur Botleigh. All that came to me was the Gaymount house, and the ground around it, which my uncle's will declared ought to remain in possession of the bearing the name of Car\ntaret.' That was the result of my hot blood, you see,-three thousand acres to Arthur, and forty to me, with the big house on it. Poor Uncle Henry!

His master, the creditor, says to him: 'Go into that field and plough the ground, for my profit, or to your desk or workship, and toil all day for me!

I didn't mean to, but I did it; and I would not let you do this, but for-my-poorchildren.' That's the way she said it, Lieutenant, crying every other word. So I up and told her to stop that way of talking. 'Come, and go to housekeeping in my den, Rose,' I said. I can go and lay down in the big house.

Well, open an account at your grocer's, your dry goods merchant's, or elsewhere, and from that moment you don't keep your money. Every day you send for a few trifles-you regard them in that light. Well, those trifles-fractions of a dollar to-day, to-morrow, and the next day-have a curious way of turning into an amount of dollars expressed by three or four figures; and then they are no trifles. You think you about twenty dollars, and you discover that it is just one hundred and twenty! Add that to what you have spent, in ten cent pieces, on cigars, and you have two hundred and forty dollars, thrown away to all intents and purposes; and that sum is the interest on four thousand dollars.

Why should the old Virginia planter, with his ten thousand acres, and his five hundred servants, 'fash his head' about grape-raising, and truck, and all that? He was obliged to raise so much corn and wheat for his immense household; he sold the surplus only, and made his profits from tobacco. That was enough, however, it made him rich. He shipped it to England to his factor; the ship brought back every luxury, velvet coats, laces, and silks, wine, and new books, and plate and jewels if he wished them; he had all that he wanted, this good gentleman with his ten thousand acres. Well, the consequence? Why, that he cultivated only corn, wheat and tobacco; they sufficed for him, and he saw no reason to change his crops. And when his son and his grandson, and his great-grandson succeeded him, they in turn said to themselves, 'Farming is raising corn, wheat and tobacco, and nothing else.' Well, that answered for a season; but the estates began to dwindle..

Truck?-grape-raising? newfangled notions! all theory! nonsense!

Take corn and wheatwhat was the average production? Was it eight barrels of corn and fifteen bushels of wheat? I doubt it; but place it at that. Well, the farmers managed to live on that, but they did not prosper. When the planter at the end of the year added up everything, he was generally very well satisfied to come out square with the world. Taking all things into consideration, he did not make five per cent. on his investment, even estimating his cwn supervision, often his labor, at nothing.

Profit means prosperity, and prosperity means churches, lyceums, academies, schools, railroads, material advancement and happiness. But this is a digression. Such was the sum total of the old system of agriculture, in the past. And do you think even that is possible to-day? If you do you are mistaken. Slavery has disappeared, and black freemen are now the laborersfreemen, each of whom costs about two hundred dollars per annum in wages and food, and who are far less efficient than they were before, under the most indulgent masters. The result? The profits of agriculture generally may be represented by the figure o. Unless you walk after the plough yourself, your land is scratched simply-not turned up. Un57 less you walk after the harvesters, your crop is half cut only, or they lag, at three dollars a-day. Work partially, or badly done, but wages and food the same. The land producing, from bad culture, one-fourth of a crop, but the cost and support of labor inexorably the same.
