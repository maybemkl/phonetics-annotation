{"utterance": "Yes, I'm afraid it's so. It's an idiotic thing, I think, and our friend Wollmer is more to blame for it than any one else. The company is losing money; it must be at present prices. All the higher salaries have been cut, but none of us has thought of grumbling. We can't expect the company to go on in times like these, when it is running behind right along, to pay us as much as it does when it is making money. It can't do it. Moreover, it will not hurt the company to shut down\u2014that is to say, that of course it hurts any company to go out of business for a while, and with a large plant like ours there is considerable actual expense and danger in shutting down and opening up again, apart from the loss of business. But the loss would not be as great as it would be from running three months with the present pay-rolls and business as it is to-day. A company hates to shut down if it can avoid it. It probably could avoid it-anyway, it is willing to try\u2014if the men would consent to the reduction. If they won't consent, the works will shut down, that is all. The men have the chance of working at about eighty per cent. of their present pay or not working at all. They cannot possibly compel the company to go on at the old scale; that would simply mean insolvency; and it is better to shut down and wait for better times than it is to fail.", "speaker": "Captain Harrington", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Jennie Masson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Two-thirds of the rest never think for themselves, and believe whatever the leaders tell them.

{"utterance": "Tell them, darling! Who can? They won't listen to anybody. The press sometimes does, but it is the papers which they don't read. The papers which they do read cater to them and encourage them. If a sensible man gets up in meeting and tries to speak, he is cried down and ridiculed; and more than that, he is treated as a spy and a \u00d3scab\u2019ever afterwards.

{"utterance": "Of course he does. Trampling the life, indeed, when it furnishes them their bread and butter! When the works were started it was not, of course, as a charitable institution. It was not with the direct inten. tion of furnishing work and a living to so many men and their families. But the result has been the same. The stockholders who have put their money into it have not so far received a penny in return. The first year the works about paid expenses. The second year they made a profit, but instead of declaring a dividend it was decided to increase the plant, and that increase is only just completed. About the time they began to put in the new machinery the finan- cial panic struck the country, and since then business bas been at a stand-still. Not only has the company not made any money, but it must have had to borrow heavily. The men who invested about two million dollars in the thing have so far not received a cent's return. More than that, they have lost about half a million or three-quarters of a million of their money. So much has just gone out of sight. There has been the depreciation in value by wear and tear in three years' run, and then in addition to that all property has gone off from twenty to thirty per cent. in value during the panic. Up to date the men who created the mills have lost some- where from half a million dollars upwards. Meanwhile they have paid for labor some five or six million dollars, first and last. Every penny there has been in it the men have got, and half a million or so to boot. They have taken no chances, and have had to stand no loss. Everything they have done they have been paid for in cash on the 10th of every month\u2014and paid in good wages, too. Some of those men get six and seven dollars a day. Now, because the company cannot stand it any longer-after it has lost money and borrowed and run behind-and has to ask the men to help it through by taking a cut in wages, they talk about tyranny and trampling the life out of them.

Perhaps we have no\nstatesman in this country to-day who is equal to the task; if\nthere were such a man-a man whose voice the nation was al-\nready accustomed to listen to, whose principles were beyond\nreproach, and his public career unstained even by a suspicion-\nhe night place himself at the head of the movement, and make\nit, perhaps, as noble in its ends as any party that the world has\nseen. But when we come to look at the Populists locally, the\ncase is different. The party is not lovely, viewed piecemeal,\nand it is becoming worse daily. I fear that it is not through\nPopulism that the salvation of the country is to come. It is\nmore likely to be through the reaction against Populism.

{"utterance": "No, not that, of course. It is not so much the reform\nwe hope to make as the revolution we hope to prevent. There\nis nothing wrong with any individual holding of property,\nhowever great; nor with all the individual holdings in the\nmass\u2014with what is called the existence of the moneyed class.\nThe individual ownerships all over the country, whether small\nor great (except in so far as they may bave been acquired by\nfraud and in violation of law), are justly held. They were\neither occupied' by the present owners, in virtue of their\nsuperior moral force or business talents, or they were inherited\nfrom those who had \u2018ocoupied' thom legally before. The\ntitles are good and in accordance with the law. The law itself\n6\n47\na\nis good and in accordance with the eternal principles of right.\nBut through the progress of generations, concurrently with\nthe building of the law, there has crystallized round the mass of\nindividual ownerships cohering together a sentiment which is\nfundamentally bad. I do not know what to call it, except the\nidea of wealth; and this idea has altogether too much influence\nin the disposition of the affairs of the nation. It is not that\nany individual millionaire or any corporation has too much in-\nfluence at Washington. It is not even that any group or class\nof individuals has too much influence. It would be difficult\nbut less difficult than invidious-to go to Washington and lay\none's finger on specific instances; instances of what in its gross-\nest form is flat bribery, and in its mildest form is the swaying\nof the Chief Executive by considerations of family and of con-\nnections in the appointment of a justice of the supreme bench,\nan appointment which in itself may be admirable. It is not, as\nI say, however, any question of individuals or of a class. If it\nwere, the matter would soon remedy itself by the constant ac-\ncessions to and defections from the moneyed classes in this\ncountry, though I take it that the infusion of new blood in the\nHouse of Lords in England every decade is scarcely less than\nthat into our aristocracy of wealth here. Yet no matter how\nthe component atoms of the class shift or rearrange themselves,\nthere is the all-pervading idea of nobility over there, with its\nthousand ramifications and associations accumulated through\nthe centuries, and there is the idea of wealth, of more recent\ngrowth but scarcely less all-permeating, here. It may be that\nneither Congress as a mass, nor any individual Congressman,\nnor any officer of the government will have been consciously\nsubjected to an undue influence during a whole session. Every\nman connected with the affairs of state may be guided by his\nconscience only, and honestly believe himself to be beyond re-\nproach, yet at the end of a session this idea will be found to\nhave been all-pervading, to have governed in the distribution\nof appointinents and pensions, in appropriations and charters\nand tariff schedules. It has not been more powerful nor less\npresent with one party than another, or one administration\nthan another. It rather accumulates strength and becomes\nmore firmly seated with each succeeding government. And\nthere lies the danger. It is no change in the law that we need, it seems\nto me; still less any disturbance of existing rights and inter-\nests. It is a sweetening of our national sentiment, a depolariz-\ning of our ideas. And I know not how that is to be reached\nexcept through the medium of a new party and new men.\nAnd it must be reached somehow, or the outlook is terrible.\nThere will be revolution.", "speaker": "Horace Marsh", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mr. Holt", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

I was prepared to discuss matters with you most fully and frankly. But all this, it appears, is useless. I may say at once, gentlemen, that the Western Iron and Steel Company will never do what you demand. We will shut down rather, and stay shut down until the plant goes to pieces from rust and rot.

We will not surrender that right. We will not throw over our non-union men whom we now have with us. We will under no circumstances recognize any union or order or brotherhood or organization or corporation as having any authority over our employ\u00e9s as our employ\u00e9s or any right to come between us and them.

And all the money that you spend, my child, goes to labor in one way or another. It is not wasted. And if you did save twenty thousand dollars a year ? That would be less than fifty cents a month divided equally among all the men. The question of wages is one of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year. Twenty thousand dollars are of no use, even if it were possible for me to give my private income to pay the companies' employ\u00e9s.

{"utterance": "It is not to make a Republican of you, but to draw you away from your present crowd. This cam- paign is not a conflict between Democrats and Republicans; even the fight of two years ago was not, though it pretended to be. The Populists are not Democrats any more than they are Republicans. In some states and localities they are fused with the Republicans to-day. They are simply the accumula- tion of the malecontents and dissidents from both parties. In every country which is under party government the people first divide themselves on some large question into two more or less equal parties. From these great bodies in the process of daily friction fragments are constantly being rubbed off, and this detritus goes on accumulating until it amounts to enough to make a third party. So, on some one issue or a jumble of issues, it finally coheres and starts out as an independent en- tity, and generally sells its support to whichever of the other two bodies is able to pay most for it at the time. In this State two years ago, as you know, the Democrats bought it. Perhaps I know more than you do of the inside of the deal. The judge doubtless knows what price the Republicans could have had it for ; but they declined the offer. What the Demo- crats got when they made the purchase was a certain number of votes. What they paid was a certain number of offices. The persons who cast the votes were the offscourings of both parties in the State\u2014all the cranks and theorists, dema- gogues, anarchists, ignoramuses, and others, who were too good or too bad to be Democrats or Republicans, or did not know enough of the English language to be either. When the hetero- geneous mass was dumped, neck and crop, into the Demo- cratic camp, there were a good many of us who shook our heads and fought shy of our new comrades. Putting myself out of the question, I think I may say that they were the best men in the party. Two years of experience of the allied forces in power has only strengthened our aversion. The present cam- paign started out on a basis of the Democratic party minus its best element, but plus the Populist offscouring, versus the Republican party. The best element of Democracy held aloof. As time has passed, and especially since the strike be- gan, the neutral Democrats have one by one gone over to the Republican camp. I myself shall vote a straight Republican ticket this fall. More than that, a great many more Demo- crats who managed to stomach the Populists two years ago are throwing them up now, and within the last week or two so much has been going on quietly that I believe that one-half the regular, old-time Democrats will be Republicans in this election. It is no longer a question of Democrat against Re- publican; it's a question of law and order and decency against mob-rule and anarchy and crime.", "speaker": "Major Bartop", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Horace Marsh", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

The mere fact of their incongruity and aimlessness-or, rather, the diversity of their aims-makes them, as a party, open to conviction. They have now no single common cause. Give them one, and they can be solidified and concentrated upon it. So far they may have been misled and used chiefly for evil. They can be led rightly and used for good\u2014for great good.

It is a necessity for all new third parties; the most that they can hope for for a while is the balance of power. The present situation in this country has had its counterpart in every coun- try and in all ages. The words \u00b7 Democrat' and \u00b7 Republican' are only symbols\u2014localizations of eternal facts. What we are saying now was doubtless said over and over again in ancient Athens and Rome.

There is little difference enough between the two parties, and little enough between the men who compose them. Neither is inspired; nor is either entirely diabolical. In the past the Democracy has shown itself capable of the worst abuses in municipal affairs, and the Republican party has produced the greatest national scandals, which is only a result of the fact that the Demo- crats have been chiefly in control in our large cities, and the Republicans most in power in federal affairs.

Even the Chinese plan (or is it Japanese ?) of wip- ing off all debts with the new year, so that every man begins even, would be no good. No one would trust them after the first year, and their last state would be worse than their first. I admire the American farmer as a whole, and have great sympathy with him. We all must have. He is a great part of our country's strength. But, again, we are considering him in the mass. Take him as an individual, and I grant his stur- diness and intelligence, and even, from a common-school point of view (in the rudiments of ordinary learning as it is taught in schools), I grant his education. But when it comes to po- litical and economic teaching, he is either as ignorant as a child or helplessly ill-taught. The ability to spell and .fig- ure' does not equip a man to use his political judgment. The bane of the farmer (of course I mean the Western farm- er) has been and is his inaccessibility. In his scattered, iso- lated situation he is not reached through the ordinary chan- nels of information by which the educated, thinking man in the city is instructed. Literature does not reach him. He is not lectured to. He is not in contact with current thought; it does not circulate in his atmosphere. The difficulty of ar- riving at and arguing with him in the mass is so great that, in each locality, he has been left to the instruction of his local prophets-usually one of himself, a farmer like himself, who has no advantage over him except a certain fluency of speech, and who is shrewd enough to see that politics offers an easier career than farming. This man is as thoroughly unfit to teach as a man could be\u2014mentally unfit, and, what is more, mor- ally unfit, because he has no larger ends to serve than his own advancement. The farmers, as a whole, are having hard times, and vaguely think that they are ill- used and need a change\u2014no matter what. The prophet arises and promises them a change \u2014 if they will send him to the legislature. Generally he attacks the nearest railway company, because that happens to be the most tangible manifestation near at hand of the concentrated wealth and power of society. On it he unloads all the burden of the farmers' ills-makes it re- sponsible for poor (or too plentiful) crops, and for the for- eign competition which affects prices in European grain-mar- kets. The farmer has no other teaching, and believes him. And there's where the trouble begins. This bas been going on all over the West now for some decades. Those who ought to have been the farmers' right teachers have let them alone-left them to the local demagogue. The result is the- Populist party. And it has not only been with the farmers proper, but with all Western communities-farming, mining, and, on a small scale, even industrial. The President of Har- vard College, a short time ago, made a speech somewhere- in St. Louis, I think-in which he said that the chief danger to the country lay in the \u201cuninformed public opinion' of the West. He was badly abused for it; but I thought it was the best thing that had been said on our public affairs for a long time. It is not only uninformed, it is mis-informed public opinion.

{"utterance": "It is a good deal easier, after all, for a man to be respected in the churches than it is to be respected in the saloons. I do not mean to say, of course, that the best men are not in the churches, or to deny that the crowd around the saloons is, as a whole, the worst element in our population. But to stand well with that element a man must possess certain good qualities which he need not have to hold high place in a church. There is a certain type of man\u2014the worst, in my opinion, that God makes \u2014 slinking, hypocritical, and cowardly, who can come to be a church-warden and to have the handling of par-ish funds, yet who could never get credit for fifteen cents' worth at a bar.\nHe wa'n't no saint, but even judgment I'd take my chance with Jim Along o' some pious gentlemen who wouldn't shake hands with him!'\nThere's a good deal in that. It is pretty hard to put one's self outside the moral environment the climate of opin-ion' \u2014 of one's own immediate day and community; but if one could look at men with the eye of eternal Truth, I wonder how far his judgment would coincide with the con-ventions and convictions of the times. In other stages of society the recklessness and animal courage\u2014the brutality, - which are the chief characteristics of the saloon ele-ment to-day, were high virtues. They went a long way tow-ards the making of a knight; for I suspect that the chivalry and courtesy which we ascribe to those gentlemen-the man-ners which were\nThe fruit\nOf loyal nature and of noble mind\nare chiefly the additions of the romancers and scribes of a later day. The average knight was a pretty coarse beast-according to our ideas. And according to his ideas, and the ideas of the world of his day, the qualities which make a man \u201crespectable' with us caused him then to be buffeted and spat upon and spanked with the flat of a sword. There is still lurking in the bottom of the hearts of all of us a cer-tain sympathy with those ideas. Is that sympathy only a relic of the brute in us, not quite civilized away, or is it a smouldering spark of a higher than human nature, a fragment of omniscience, which has not altogether been stifled? Is it better or worse than our current code of morality ? After all, respectability' is only a negation-a lack of certain attri-butes. Are those attributes inherently evil, or is it only that society - a most ephemeral society - says that they are evil in its cowardice? Is it better-better, I mean, in the view of all time\u2014to have wine mixed in one's veins and chew tobacco and attend prize-fights, or to be a man whose \u00b7 blood is very snow-broth'\u2014and to take an interest in Sunday-schools ?", "speaker": "Horace Marsh", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mr. Barry", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

But, for my part, I cannot understand how a man can be one thing on the platform and another at the dinner-table. Perhaps it is only woman's ignorance; perhaps I am prudish.

The Democratic leaders wanted the labor vote, and the Democratic organs prepared to bid for the support of the strikers at once, before there was a possibility of the other fellows getting ahead of them. Horace happened to be the only party leader who was making a speech that evening. They took his speech and tacked on to it a lot of stuff as a text on which to preach. Horace, as I have said, was furious when he read it. He was dissuaded from contradicting it publicly by the arguments of his friends, who appealed to him not to make a split in the party ranks at such a critical moment.

{"utterance": "I suppose he thinks that he bas expressed himself once, and that is enough. He cannot be accused of not being friendly to the strikers; there is that speech to prove his friendship. And now he hopes to keep the good-will of the other side\u2014my good-will and my father's\u2014by keeping silent, and in private disown- ing the one thing that he has said.

It may sound absurd at first, but I believe your real sense of justice will tell you to act upon it. Horace is speaking to- night at Columbus Hall. I tell you that you have wronged him bitterly. You think you have not. You were wishing, a short time since, that there was somewhere to go this evening. Come and hear him. Come and listen with your own ears to the doctrines which he teaches, and let your own judgment decide for you whether he is a traitor or not.

That was one of the things which drew\nme to you,\nI think. I have never dared to go back there,\nnot for twenty years, lest some one should recognize me.\nBut I have so often longed to ask you about old people and\nplaces there! I left there when I was eighteen and went to\nBoston, where I only stayed for three years. For the next\nfive I wandered a good deal, chiefly in New England, and\nfinally drifted to New York, and thence to Freehold. I lived\nthere for nearly four years.\nIt was in\nmy\nlast\nyear\nthat I\nmet Mrs. Brady, and fell in love with her. I trust you will\nbelieve, gentlemen, that there was nothing wrong in our rela-\ntions. There was not. I intended to marry her. We were\nthen both about thirty years of age; and if I could have\nafforded it I would have married at once.\nBut I was poor,\nand had hard times to get along. It was out of my poverty\nthat grew the thing which ruined me. I was honest, or\nmeant to be, but I was in debt, and the debt grew larger\nevery month. My practice was small, and I am by nature\nincapable of economy. Finally I owed every body in town\nmoney-small amounts. The whole of my obligations did\nnot reach seven hundred dollars. But I saw no way to pay\neven that; and I was being dunned\u2014dunned for humiliating\nsums-until at last I grew wild and-disappeared! It was a\nhopeless mistake. I ought to have lived on there, and fought\nit through somehow-at least, if I went, I should have gone\nopenly, and with my creditors' consent. But I was inex-\nperienced in business. I had not the courage to face the\nmusic, and I fled-just ran away. I always intended to pay\nevery cent as soon as I had the money; but I thought if I\nstopped to tell my creditors so that they would make trouble.\nSo I just left everything and struck West.", "speaker": "General Harter", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "the lawyer Pawson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

In Detroit I failed to get a footing,\nand wandered on to the Pacific slope, and thence drifted\nback here. Meanwhile I was making acquaintances, and\nmaking them under my new name.\nThen I took to politics.\nThe rubbing against people of all classes and different sec-\ntions of the country gave me a certain facility in making\nfriends-taught me how to get along in any company in\nwhich I found myself. That helped me to come to the\nfront in politics; but it did not bring me money. I am not\nover-scrupulous, perhaps, in some ways, and am willing to\nwink at other men's dishonesty for the party's sake; but I\nam afraid that I have always been too honest\u2014or too coward-\nly, it may be, when it came to making money for myself-\nto get rich. Not until the last two or three years could I\never at one time have commanded seven hundred dollars of\nspare money.

{"utterance": "Jennie and I, were sitting in a section about the middle of the car, sitting facing each other, I with my back to the engine. In the next section on the opposite side of the car-so that they were behind Jennie as she sat, but so that I was facing Mrs. Carrington-were the Carringtons. I happened to be looking at her when I saw her apparently catch the eye of somebody behind me\u2014somebody, as I supposed, who was entering the car. You know the kind of look-a sudden glance of secret recognition and no more. I heard some one coming along the aisle behind me, and I saw Mrs. Carrington me see- raise her eyes to him again. The man came alongside of me and passed on, and then I saw it was Blakely. He did not speak to Mrs. Carrington or she to him; but he went straight on to the second section on her side, so that he was directly behind her. Carrington, all this time, had been read- ing his paper. After a bit, when the train began to move, he got up to go to the smoking-car, and then he saw Blakely. He leaned over and said something to his wife, and she flushed up angrily. Carrington then went out. I suppose-let -it was ten minutes afterwards that Blakely went out too. This time, in passing, as he came up behind Mrs. Car- rington, he stooped slightly, and said a few words to her in an undertone. She replied, but without looking up, and Blakely strolled out of the car in the same direction as Car- rington had gone.", "speaker": "Captain Harrington", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Horace Marsh", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "I had happened to notice it, but did not think much of it all. I am not sure that I think anything of it now. But it was an hour and a half or two hours later-nearly ten o'clock-and we were waiting while our berths were being made up. Jennie was sitting in some other section, among a lot of valises and things, and I was standing in the aisle, leaning against a seat and watching the porter at work. It was one of those sixteen-section cars, I think they call them, that they run now on the trains that have a regular smoking-car - the aisle, you know, goes straight through at the end out to the vestibule, instead of kinking round a corner to get by the smoking-compartment, as it used to do. You can look straight out to the platform, as you can in a day-coach, from the centre of the car. It happened that I turned my head to the forward end of the car, and my eye lighted on the door just as a man came to the glass and looked in. It was Carrington. He did not come in, but stayed out on the platform, and I saw him open the vestibule door.", "speaker": "Captain Harrington", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Horace Marsh", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Again I don't think I thought anything of it, because I turned to watch the porter. A few minutes afterwards I happened to look up again, and Carrington was still out in the vestibule. I looked back to see if Mrs. Carrington had retired, and she had. Then the porter finished our section, and I put Jennie's satchel into the lower berth and said good- night to her. I had the upper berth above her.", "speaker": "Captain Harrington", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Horace Marsh", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "While I was saying good-night I was conscious of hear- ing angry voices. I was too much occupied with my first good-night to my wife to pay much attention to them, and I know that I had a sort of vague idea that it was the conduct- or swearing at the brakeman or something. A minute later, as I finished buttoning the curtain of Jennie's berth, the door at the end of the car was opened, and Carrington came in. I sort of squeezed myself against the berth to let him pass me.", "speaker": "Captain Harrington", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Horace Marsh", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "It was not until I got an afternoon paper at Buffalo the next day that I saw the news of Blakely's death. They said that his body was picked up at a point where the train passed at ten five. I know that when I took out my watch to wind it up that night it was ten twenty.", "speaker": "Captain Harrington", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Horace Marsh", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Now I may be talking about nothing at all, and I should never think of mentioning it to anybody except you two fel- lows, and I hope you won't talk to any one else.
