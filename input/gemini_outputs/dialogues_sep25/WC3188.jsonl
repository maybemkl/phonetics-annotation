Then we have a parlor, and can leave people out if they don't do as we direct. And you, oh, you are no end of a card. You see there are so many prettyish girls here, but none that are new, none that amount to anything for a sensation. You've seen them all winter in silks and serges, and now you see them all summer in grenadines and muslins. The same dogs with different collars. Positively I should think the men would de15 test the sight of them; I know I do. And no force, no originality; just prettyish, fastish, stylish; that's the best you can say of any of them.

I will only add this assurance to you, that I have done all I could for her comfort and safety, and that she is at present in the city. I think her health improving, though she is much shattered by all she has passed through.\nYour letters come very regularly, but I think they might be longer; now, don't you think they might yourself? But suppose I am not the one to talk about short letters.\nAffectionately your mother, ISABELLA VARIAN.", "speaker": "Isabella Varian", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Felix Varian", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "I suppose mamma has told you (or no, I believe she (So said she hadn't told you, and that I must do it when I wrote) about the Rothermels, and all that that poor girl has gone through. She stayed at Milford all the winter; nothing could persuade her to come away even for a little visit, although mamma wrote and asked them. (I think it was very kind of her, for George, poor fellow, would have been very tiresome in the house.) But Dorla would not come. And towards spring, George was taken down with that same dreadful fever that he had the year before.\nafter all it wasn't on account of Dorla's treatment of him, that he was so ill, then. I should think it would have aggravated her to know it, after making such a sacrifice; but no matter now.) Then the old mother was taken down, and Dorla nursed them both, and none of the neighbors would come near them. George lay between life and death, six weeks and more, and then, poor fellow, (I always liked him, he was so good-natured!) then he died, and after that the mother. Then Dorla broke down at last, and had a frightful illness. I don't know whether it was the fever or what it was, but for some time she was in the greatest danger.\nMamma was very kind; she sent up nurses, and a doctor, and everything that she could think of to make her comfortable. It must have been very lonely for the poor thing; but then she's always led a lonely kind of life. Her baby was born in May, and as soon as it was old enough, mamma insisted that she should come away from that dreadful place, and the last of June she came here with it for a week or two, and stayed while we looked up apartments for her. Thank Heaven, she has left Milford, and never wants to look at it again. There does not seem to be any one to do anything for her. The guardian, or the person who looks after her property (and she is quite well off, they say), is a stupid sort of person, who never seems to think she needs any care, and bestows it all upon her bonds and mortgages. She is now very comfortably fixed in pretty airy rooms, and has good servants. Mamma insists she must go out of town; but she 257 doesn't seem inclined to go with us, though mamma asked. her, and seems disappointed. I suppose she wants to be more quiet. She promises to go somewhere bye and bye. But I don't think she ought to be alone. She really looks most shockingly. You'd never say she had ever been' a pretty person. The child isn't in the least like her; a little white, scared-looking thing. I can't imagine what she sees in it.\nBut then I am not fond of children. Now good-bye. This is the longest letter!
