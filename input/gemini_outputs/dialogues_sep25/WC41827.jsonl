Give me the secret of thy life to lay Asleep within my own, Nor dream that it shall mock thee any day By any sign or tone. Nay, as in walking through some convent-close, Passing beside a well, Oft have we thrown a red and scented rose To watch it as it fell; Knowing that never more the rose shall rise To shame us, being dead; Watching it spin and dwindle till it lies At rest, a speck of red\u2014 Thus, I beseech thee, down the silent deep And darkness of my heart, Cast thou a rose; give me a rose to keep, My friend, before we part. For, as thou passest down thy garden-ways, Many a blossom there Groweth for thee: lilies and laden bays, And rose and lavender. But down the darkling well one only rose In all the year is shed; And o'er that chill and secret wave it throws A sudden dawn of red.\"", "speaker": "narrator", "speaker_in_char_list": false, "addressee": "friend", "addressee_in_char_list": false}
