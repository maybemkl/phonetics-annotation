His father's money, which they say was an investment for him in Carson's Bank five years ago, is as good as any one's, and his father's blood won't hurt him in California or the Southwest. At least, he is received everywhere, and Don Juan Robinson was his guardian. Indeed, as far as social status goes, it might be a serious question if the actual daughter of the late John Silsbee, of Pike County, and the adopted child of John Peyton was in the least his superior. As Father Sobriente evidently knew Clarence's former companionship with Susy and her parents, it would be hardly politic for us to ignore it or seem to be ashamed of it.

But that confir mation was only of Victor's great-grand father's title, and it is now alleged that as Victor's father died without making a will, Victor has claimed and disposed of property which he ought to have divided with his sis ters. At least, some speculating rascals in San Francisco have set up what they call 'the Sisters' title,' and are selling it to ac tual settlers on the unoccupied lands beyond. As, by the law, it would hold possession against the mere ordinary squatters, whose only right is based, as you know, on the presumption that there is no title claimed, it gives the possessor immunity to enjoy the use of the property until the case is decided, and even should the original title hold good against his, the successful litigant would probably be willing to pay for improve ments and possession to save the expensive and tedious process of ejectment.", "speaker": "Peyton", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Clarence", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Anyhow, there was such a big skeer that one of the Greaser gang, who thought he 'd seen the ghost, being a Papist, to save his everlasting soul went to the priest and confessed. But the priest would n't give him absolution until he 'd blown the hull thing, and made it public. And then it turned out that all the dockyments for the title, and even the custom - house paper, were forged by Pedro Valdez, and put on the market by his confederates. And that 's just where your friend, Clarence Brant, comes in, for Tie had bought up the whole title from them fellers. Now, either, as some say, he was in the fraud from the be- ginnin', and never paid anything, or else he was an all-fired fool, and had parted with his money like one. Some allow that the reason was that he was awfully sweet on Mrs. Peyton's adopted daughter, and ez the parents did n't approve of him, he did this so as to get a holt over them by the prop erty. But he 's a ruined man, anyway, now; for they say he 's such a darned fool that he 's goin' to pay for all the improve ments that the folks who bought under him put into the land, and that '11 take his last cent.

Well, as a result, I find, Mr. Brant, that there is no record whatever of his wonderfully providential purchase of the Sisters' title from you; that he never entered into any written agreement with you, and never paid you a cent; and that, furthermore, his papers show me that he never even contemplated it ; nor, indeed, even knew of your owning the title when he died. Yes, Mr. Brant, it was all to your foresight and prudence, and your generosity alone, that we owe our present possession of the rancho. When you helped us into that awful window, it was your house we were entering; and if it had been you, and not those wretches, who had chosen to shut the doors on us after the funeral, we could never have entered here again.

But I want you to think, as I honestly do, that it is the best for her. She has married in her profession, which is a great protection and a help to her success, and she has married a man who can look lightly upon certain qualities in her that others might not be so lenient to. His worst faults are on the surface, and will wear away in contact with the world, and he looks up to her as his supe rior. I gathered this from her friend, for I did not speak with her myself ; I did not go there to see her.

{"utterance": "Then suppose we speak of the Misses Hernandez, with whom you scarcely ex changed a word at dinner, and whom I invited for you and your fluent Spanish. They are charming girls, even if they are a little stupid. But what can I do? If I am to live here, I must have a few young people around me, if only to make the place cheer ful for others. Do you know I have taken a great fancy to Mary Rogers, and have asked her to visit me. I think she is a good friend of yours, although perhaps she is a little shy. What 's the matter? You have nothing against her, have you?", "speaker": "Mrs. Peyton", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Clarence", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "I know you will despise me, hate me ; and, perhaps, worst of all, disbelieve me; but I swear to you, now, that I have always loved you, yes, always ! When first I came here, it was not to see my old play mate, but yow, for I had kept the memory of you as I first saw you when a boy, and you have always been my ideal. I have thought of, dreamed of, worshiped, and lived for no other woman. Even when I found Susy again, grown up here at your side; even when I thought that I might, with your consent, marry her, it was that I might be with you always ; that I might be a part of your home, your family, and have a place with her in your heart ; for it was you I loved, and you only. Don't laugh at me, Mrs. Peyton, it is the truth, the whole truth, I am telling you. God help me!", "speaker": "Clarence", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mrs. Peyton", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "You ridiculous? You a beautiful woman, my superior in every thing, the mistress of these lands where I am only steward made ridiculous, not by my presumption, but by my confession? Was the saint you just now admired in Father Esteban's chapel ridiculous because of the peon clowns who were kneeling be fore it?", "speaker": "Clarence", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mrs. Peyton", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "Not until I have told you all, and I must before I leave you. I loved you when I came here, even when your husband was alive. Don't be angry, Mrs. Peyton; he would not, and need not, have been an gry; he would have pitied the foolish boy, who, in the very innocence and ignorance of his passion, might have revealed it to him as he did to everybody but one. And yet, I sometimes think you might have guessed it, had you thought of me at all. It must have been on my lips that day I sat with you in the boudoir. I know that I was filled with it; with it and with you; with your presence, with your beauty, your grace of heart and mind, yes, Mrs. Peyton, even with your own unrequited love for Susy. Only, then, I knew not what it was.", "speaker": "Clarence", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mrs. Peyton", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "But I think /can tell you what it was then, and now, I remember it very well. You told me then that I re minded you of your mother. Well, I am not old enough to be your mother, Mr. Brant, but I am old enough to have been, and might have been, the mother of your wife. That was what you meant then ; that is what you mean now. I was wrong to ac cuse you of trying to make me ridiculous. I ask your pardon. Let us leave it as it was that day in the boudoir, as it is now. Let me still remind you of your mother, I know she must have been a good woman to have had so good a son, and when you have found some sweet young girl to make you happy, come to me for a mother's bless ing, and we will laugh at the recollection and misunderstanding of this evening.", "speaker": "Mrs. Peyton", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Clarence", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "I said you reminded me of my mother, he went on at her side, because I knew her and lost her only as a child. She never was anything to me but a memory, and yet an ideal of all that was sweet and lovable in woman. Perhaps it was a dream of what she might have been when she was as young in years as you. If it pleases you still to misunderstand me, it may please you also to know that there is a reminder of her even in this. I have no remembrance of a word of affection from her, nor a caress; I have been as hopeless in my love for her who was my mother, as of the woman I would make my wife.", "speaker": "Clarence", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mrs. Peyton", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

And if if I should listen to you, what would the world say, what would you yourself say a few years hence ? Oh, be reasonable. Think of it, it would be so wild, so mad ! so so utterly ridiculous !", "speaker": "Mrs. Peyton", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Clarence", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Please ! Don't you see I am behind these bars? Think of them as the years that separate us, my poor, dear, foolish boy.
