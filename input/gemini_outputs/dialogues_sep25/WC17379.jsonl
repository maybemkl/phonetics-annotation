You'd never guess, so I may as well tell you. It seems my mother, who is still handsome, and goes out a good deal, is thinking of marrying again. Now the person she has chosen is a merchant in the City, very wealthy; but the connection does not suit my uncle's taste, and he has sent me a message through the colonel, who is a great friend of his (being doubtless afraid to broach the subject himself), that if I will write to my mother, refusing my consent to her marriage, and farther saying that in the event of her persisting in her determination I must decline having any thing more to say to her, he will then not only purchase all my future steps, and make me the very handsome allowance of \u00a3800 per annum, but also declare me his heir.

Then, seeing me unmoved by that, he went on to state that in the event of my refusing to do as he wished, my uncle had determined to have nothing more to do with me, but to leave me in future to sink or swim, as best I could. To that I replied, that while I repudiated 11 the charge of sentimentalism, it was my earnest wish to try and do what I saw manifestly to be my duty, and that in no way could I feel it to be my duty to prevent my mother providing herself with a comfortable home in her old age to gratify my uncle's pride.

{"utterance": "Well, if you really feel inclined to undertake riding him,' interrupted Hemmings, quickly, I think you would be about the most likely person I could meet with.

You can come too if you like, Cameron. I know a nice retired spot, where we can get a good gallop without being observed,' answered Hugh; and you, Cairnsford, bring out Jocelyn, for I may want you to give me a lead over the first fence.

This is the way of it, Sir: if you pull him he'll rear up`and fall atop of you, as sure as eggs is eggs; but if he pulls you, and you can't manage to stop him some way, he'll take you wherever he chooses to go, and that's most like to be the shortest way home.", "speaker": "stable-man", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Hugh Melton", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

I'd hardly have dared myself to take him first at that first fence, and yet I see now it was the right thing to do; he's a queer, nervous, irritable temper, that gets flurried and excited when he sees the others going before him. I say, look there-Firefly is creeping up to the favorite. I didn't believe Solace when he talked so eternally of his mare Firefly, and all she could do. I'm beginning to think more of her now. What a stayer she must be! She looks as fresh as a daisy, and goes along whisking her wicked-looking tail as though it was all play to her.

Don't you remember telling me I ought to have a fixed object in life? Well, I have chosen painting for my object, and have followed it up closely ever since.

Even then he did not speak out explicitly, only hinted darkly all was not right, till, seeing at last that his innuendoes produced rather a contrary effect from what he wished, he was obliged to be more distinct. Besides, he said that though fear had kept you from falling into a flagrant offense since then, still he saw by your manner that, far from being repentant, you felt nothing but hatred for the man who had spared you. He says he now sees it would have been better such a character should Thus encouraged, Brabazon, still greatly terri- have left the regiment at once rather than re- main in it to have the opportunity of influencing young fellows recently joined in a manner which can do them nothing but harm.

He thought nothing of it at the time; but when he heard of the loss of the money, imagine his feelings. He says, Captain Melton, he was so taken aback by your effrontery in saying out boldly at mess that you had been in the room, that at first he thought you must have been innocent; but after that affair with Tufton he became uneasy, charged you with the theft to your face, forced you to acknowledge it, and then, he says, his first wrong step was taken. Instead of going on the spot to James or the colonel, and telling what he had discovered, he allowed himself to be persuaded into keeping the matter secret. Your penitence, he said, seemed so great and your grief so abject, that he really had not the heart to ruin your prospects in life without giving you one more chance. Now, I should never have fancied Cameron to be good-natured enough to do that kind of thing; and I must say in this matter I think he was altogether too lenient.", "speaker": "Brabazon", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Hugh Melton and Solace", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

You have told me you have some secret connected with him in your keeping. What it may be I know not; but I feel confident that it is to revenge himself for your having become acquainted with his secret he has invented this report, in the hope that though few would venture to disbelieve your denial, yet such a taint of suspicion would linger round you as might compel you to sell out in order to escape its atmosphere. I see his plan, and a cunningly devised one it is; but if you consider yourself sufficiently absolved from your promise by his conduct, tell me the mystery, and we will together devise some plan to make his villainy recoil on his own head.", "speaker": "Cairnsford", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Hugh Melton", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

But there is another nobler and purer love-surely you know it-a love that desires the good of the beloved object only, and is content to suffer if that object may be happy.
