This man was false to me. He betrayed two friends of mine as spies. I could have forgiven it had it been only foolish jealousy, but it was, I have since learned from his own lips, only that he might gratify his spite against the Commander-in-Chief by procuring their arrest and making a serious difficulty in the American camp, by means of which he hoped to serve his own ends. He told me this, believing that I sympathized with him in his hatred of the Commander-in-Chief, and in his own wrongs and sufferings. I confess, to my shame, Major Van Zandt, that two days ago I did believe him, and that I looked upon you as a mere catch-poll or bailiff of the tyrant. That I found out how I was deceived when I saw the Commander-in- Chief, you, Major, who know him so well, need not be told.

If you had really loved me, your heart, as a woman's, would have warned you against that which my heart, as a gentleman's, has made a law of honour.
