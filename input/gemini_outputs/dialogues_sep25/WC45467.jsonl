You made me believe it was she who planned the whole escape, that you were but her instrument. I went with hope I had never known before, and that hope was killed long months ago, long before we lost all hope for the cause of our blessed South. Only after you disappeared, leaving no trace behind, did I learn the whole truth. Only after Appomattox did I hear through Belden of your safe and glorious return. I am glad no Virginians were in your front that December day at Nashville. I have often wished I had died with Garnett and Armistead that grand, but fatal afternoon at Gettysburg, and had been buried there where I lay among your guns, but it pleased God to order that I should be with Pickett to the last. Say to dear Aunty Heatherwood that, so long as I live, I shall remember her loving-kindness. Tell her that friends in England offer me an opening there, and that within a few weeks I shall be on my way to London, it appearing that I am no longer 'wanted' to answer to the charge of being a spy. Tell her I saw the Waddells at their old home, reunited and, except Laura, reconcilable. Between you and me, that young woman is the worst Reb I ever saw. Frank is a manly fellow, who will soon restore the family fortunes, but as for Laura she declaims against you Yankees from morn till night, despite the New England blood that flowed in her mother's veins and twangs at times in the tones of her otherwise melodious voice; despite the more damaging fact that she is believed to hold prisoner a New Hampshire heart, that of one Lieutenant Pettingill, whom we captured wounded at Cold Harbor; and so loyal a Rebel is she that, following the example of your government, she refuses to exchange her prisoner for a Virginian of equal rank who, in the interest of harmony between the sections, is said to be willing to offer himself. At this moment Mr. Pettingill is believed to be home on parole, but within easy call of that kittenish patte de velours at Leesburg. It is my belief that, in her longing to whip the whole Yankee nation as it deserves, Miss Waddell has determined to hold him for life, leaving the whippings to be administered in the by and by to a generation yet unborn. And now, to yourself\u2014the man who gave me life and liberty and saved me from a shameful fate -I have no words with which to say how deep is my gratitude, or with what full heart I pray God's blessing on you-on you and Belle.", "speaker": "Floyd Fairfax", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mr. George Lowndes", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
