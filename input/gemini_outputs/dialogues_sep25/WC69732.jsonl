{"utterance": "Gallantly in spirit,\nBut with a subtle sluggishness of blood\nThat foils medicaments. In other men,\nWhen fever finds a lodgment, pulses bound,\nAnd fire curvets through vein and artery.\nBut in Lorenzo's body it eschews\nB\n9\nAll customary channels, diving down\nThrough subterranean currents to the seat\nOf sensitive existence. He is like\nThose flowers which in the summer of their bloom\nAre dying at the root.", "speaker": "LEONI", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "SCALA", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
