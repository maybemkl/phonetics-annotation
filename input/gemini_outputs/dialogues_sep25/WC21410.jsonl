You need not be disappointed if those you try to influence are at first reluctant to accept your views, for what has developed through much pondering to a conviction in your mind, may as yet be only an idea in theirs. Take them along afoot for a time, and if your arguments are good, they will finally be willing to ride with you at a gallop. No man ever accomplished a great object without first preparing himself for the task. This is done by thoroughly saturating one's self with knowledge at the expense of ignorant conceit, the cultivation of patience at the expense of over-activity, reasonableness at the expense of petulance, and personal influence at the expense of austerity. And here let me remind you that personal influence is greatest when the ego is least, for when the ego is prominent one is catering to his own weakness, when he should be catering to the weaknesses of those he wishes to influence.\nPersonal influence based on knowledge always gives weight, while that based on conviviality gives lustre only, which in society goes farther than merit, but not so when dollars are involved.

If I were conversing with learned men of my profession I should classify them under the title Manie sans d\u00e9lire of Pinel, or, I might use some of the shorter terms, as Moralisches irresein, Folie raisonnante or Folie lucide, but when conversing with laymen I am always careful to confine myself to the commoner forms of expression, even though they do grate harshly upon my trained tympanum, as I consider it bad taste and indicative of sham to talk over the heads of one's listeners. This moral disease of conceit has a ravenous appetite. It devours everything palatable and rejects everything that is not. In studying the laws of human economy, as it becomes all learned physicians to do, and I am proud to say that I belong to that class and have expended much thought and original research upon these matters, we find if there be any weakness, be it physical or mental, or, speaking more scientifically, corporal or psychical,\u2014as I have said I prefer using common terms in conversation with the laity,\u2014all development is along that line, and when the weakness is psychical one becomes a unipersonalist, which when stripped of its religious application means a person with one idea.
