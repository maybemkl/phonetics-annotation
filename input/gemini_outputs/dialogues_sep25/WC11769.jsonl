You see there was a yard of it had got faded by lying in the shop-window, and there were one or two holes and imperfections in it, and you ought to have heard the talk I made! I abused it to right and left, and actually at last I brought the poor wretch to believe that he ought to be grateful to me for taking it off his hands. Well, you see the dress I've made of it. The imperfections- didn't hurt it the least in the world as I managed it,\u2014 and the faded breadth makes a good apron, so you see. And just so I got that red spotted flannel dress I wore last win- ter. It was moth-eaten in one or two places, and I made them let me have it at half-price; made exactly as good a dress. But after all, Mara, I can't trim a bonnet as you can, and I can't come up to your embroidery, nor your lace-work, nor I can't draw and paint as you can, and I can't sing like you; and then as to all those things you talk with Mr. Sewell about, why they're beyond my depth, that's all I've got to say. Now, you are made to have poetry written to you, and all that kind of thing one reads of in novels. Nobody would ever think of writing poetry to me, now, or sending me flowers and rings, and such things.

And then I felt a sort of strange sense that something was coming some great trial or affliction - and I groaned and clung to Moses, and asked him to put his arm around me and hold me. Then it seemed to be not by our sea-shore that this was happening, but by the Sea of Galilee, just as it tells about it in the Bible, and there were fishermen mending their nets, and men sitting counting their money, and I saw Jesus come walking along, and heard him say to this one and that one, \u2018Leave all and follow me,\u2019 and it seemed that the moment he spoke they did it, and then he came to me, and I felt his eyes in my very soul, and he said, \u2018Wilt thou leave all and follow me?\u2019 I cannot tell now what a pain I felt what an anguish. I wanted to leave all, but my heart felt as if it were tied and woven with a thousand threads, and while I waited he seemed to fade away, and I found myself then alone and unhappy, wishing that I could, and mourning that I had not; and then something shone out warm like the sun, and I looked up, and he stood there looking pitifully, and he said again just as he did before, \u2018Wilt thou leave all and follow me?\u2019 Every word was so gentle and full of pity, and I looked into his eyes and could not look away; they drew me, they warmed me, and I felt a strange, won- derful sense of his greatness and sweetness. It seemed as if I felt within me cord after cord breaking, I felt so free, so happy; and I said, \u2018I will, I will, with all my heart;\u2019 and I woke then, so happy, so sure of God's love. I saw so clearly how his love is in everything, and these words came into my mind as if an angel had spoken them, \u2018God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.\u2019 Since then I cannot be unhappy. I was so myself only this morning, and now I wonder that any one can have a grief when God is so loving and good, and cares so sweetly for us all.
