Thrue for you, leftenant,' sez Oi, it's into a trap that the leddy hez led us, God save her!' Whisht,' he sez, take my horse, it's the strongest. Go beside her, and when Oi say the word lift her up into the saddle before ye, and gallop like blazes. Oi 'll bring up the rear and the other horse.'

And sure enough the braves made as if they would folly, but the leftenant throws the reins of her horse over the horn of his saddle, and whips out his revolver and houlds 'em back till I've got well away to the trail again.

And then he knows they have arrms wid 'em and are hostiles,' and he rowls the nearest one over, wheelin' and fightin' and coverin' our retreat till we gets to the road agin.

Even when he turned towards the wagon, I knew it was n't you he was after, but suthin' else, and I kinder hoped, Miss, that you, being different and quicker-minded than the rest, would see it too. All the while them folks were yellin' behind me to fire-as if I did n't you know my work. I was half-way down and then screamed! And then I forgot everything, everything but standing clear of hitting you, and I fired. I was that savage that I wanted to believe that he 'd gone mad, and would have touched you, till I got down there and found the honey-pot lying alongside of him.
