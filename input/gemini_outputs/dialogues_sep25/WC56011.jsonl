Remember in everything you do you are serving God. Do everything cheerfully-gladly. Tell Mary not to tease and to keep her face at least half clean. Tell Lucy I wish I had her here now with a little salt and pepper and mustard. I would eat her for dinner.

{"utterance": "With some experience, but not as much as desired, to justify an opinion, we pronounce Mr. Cable the most de- lightful of visitors. Every day some new charm is found in him. He glides into the bosom of the family before we are aware, without effort, and becomes one of us. He carries an atmosphere with him which gently and insensibly envelops the household. But the greatest charm of all was revealed when he gave Skibo Castle inmates a reading, for which the large hall was admirably adapted. Altogether fine as the performance was, the most striking feature was this slender little delicate writer of books, revealing himself as an actor of great dramatic force. For an hour he held us all spellbound. There is, however, one serious fault with this wonderful man, his visits are too short; although this has another side. He could not stay very long before we should be- come so dependent upon his presence as to feel his absence too severely. Better not get too well acquainted with him.", "speaker": "Andrew Carnegie", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "unspecified", "addressee_in_char_list": false}

{"utterance": "DEAR MR. CABLE: In justice to your audience of this evening, we think you should be told that the people of the old Puritan town of Dare still under the grim influence of Salem witch- craft and persecution of Quakers. Laughter still seems to them a little immoral and applause something to be in- dulged in with extreme moderation. Could you have heard the comments of the occupants of that horse-car mentioned by you at the introduction of your story, you would have learned how deep an impression your reading had made. As for us, we are not D people, and we laughed, wept and applauded as we chose. No, we laughed and wept as you chose, and applauded as we chose. And now, we thank you for one of the great pleasures of our lives. We are not autograph hunters and so simply sign ourselves,", "speaker": "TWO OF THE AUDIENCE", "speaker_in_char_list": false, "addressee": "G. W. Cable", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

My main purpose in writing this is to thank you for your intention, and to say that I regret your name was not in the list of those to whom I replied.", "speaker": "George W.
