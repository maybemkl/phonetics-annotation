For instance, I knew a little boy, a while ago, whose mamma told him not to touch green apples or currants, because they would make him sick.

{"utterance": "But, if you think 'it strange to see a musical instrument put in a little box, what would you think if I could tell you of one which was so small as to be put in a bird's throat?", "speaker": "Jamie's mother", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Jamie", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "In a bird's throat! who ever heard of such a thing?", "speaker": "Jamie", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Jamie's mother", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Well, there is a boy in this room who has been listening this morning to a little instrument which is inside of a bird's throat, and which can make sweeter music than this box; and yet he did not seem to wonder at it at all.", "speaker": "Jamie's mother", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Jamie", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "When you went into the fields, did you not hear robins and blue-birds playing on little instruments in their throats, and making all sorts of sweet sounds?

{"utterance": "O, I know what you mean now, you mean my little Canary bird is like a music-box. Well, but what sort of an instrument has he got in his throat? I'm sure I don't know.", "speaker": "Jamie", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Jamie's mother", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "A flute in his throat, what a funny idea!", "speaker": "Jamie", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Jamie's mother", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "It is even so. The little pipe through which the Canary bird plays his tunes is more curiously made than any flutes which any instrument-maker ever formed; it is so small, yet so perfect; it fits into his throat so easily as never to interrupt his eating or breathing; and it turns whichever way he bends his head. Did you ever hear of any musical instrument that was as curious as this?", "speaker": "Jamie's mother", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Jamie", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "It is made of little elastic rings.", "speaker": "Jamie's mother", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Jamie", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Elastic! what is that?", "speaker": "Jamie", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Jamie's mother", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Why, like India rubber, springy and easily bent; and its being made of so many little elastic rings is the reason why he can turn and bend his throat without any inconvenience, which he could not do if it were a straight, stiff pipe like a flute.", "speaker": "Jamie's mother", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Jamie", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
