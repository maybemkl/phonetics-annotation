Half the girls on this circuit would like to marry you, and if you were to help one of them over the fence, or hold her bridlerein for her while she gets on the horse, or talk five minutes with her about the turnip crop, she would consider herself next thing to engaged.

{"utterance": "Why, everybody. I hadn't more than touched the circuit at Boggs' Corners till I heard that you were to be married at this very Quarterly Meeting. And I felt a little grieved that you should go so far without any consultation with me. I stopped at Sister Sims's-she's Ann Eliza's aunt I believe-and told her that I supposed you and Sister Ann Eliza were going to require my aid pretty soon, and she burst into tears. She said that if there had been anything between you and Ann Eliza, it must be broken off, for you hadn't stopped there at all on your last round. Now tell me the plain truth, brother.

{"utterance": "I have thought about it. She is good-looking and I could not be with her without liking her. Then, too, everybody said that she was cut out for a preacher's wife. But I never paid her any attention that could be called courtship. I stopped going there because somebody had bantered me about her. I was afraid of talk. I will not deny that I was a little taken with her, at first, but when I thought of marrying her I found that I did not love her as one ought to love a wife-as much as I had once loved somebody else. And then, too, you know that nine out of every ten who marry have to locate sooner or later, and I don't want to give up the ministry. I think it's hard if a man cannot help a girl in distress without being forced to marry her.", "speaker": "Mort Goodwin", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Brother Magruder", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Well, Brother Goodwin, we'll not discuss the matter further. I have confidence in you. You have done a great wrong, whether you meant it or not.\nThere is only one way of making the thing right. It's a bad thing for a preacher to have a broken heart laid at his door. Now I tell you that I don't know anybody who would make a better preacher's wife than Sister Meacham.

Live above reproach and act like a Christian. I am sorry 241 you have involved yourself.
