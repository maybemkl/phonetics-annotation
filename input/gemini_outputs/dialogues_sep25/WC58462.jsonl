His per fect willingness to hold himself personally responsible to each of the parties, his gen uine concern at the disastrous effect of the mistake, mingled with his own alarm at the state of his system, which er failed to er respond to the peculiar qualities of the medicine, was most becoming to him as a man of honor and a gentleman !
