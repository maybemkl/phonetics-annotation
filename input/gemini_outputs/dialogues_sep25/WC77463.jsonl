We are showing our reliance upon your loyalty in the most conclusive manner by depending upon your co\u00f6peration in this scheme. Besides, any doubts that you have naturally felt as to the expediency of showing your hand may well be set at rest by recent events. The rebels are disheartened by defeat. All their heavy artillery was left behind in the flight from New York; they are without military stores for offensive operations, or camp supplies to lie long upon the defensive. Local jealousies distract the rabble they call their army; its two best regiments - the Marblehead fishermen and Morgan's Virginia riflemen-are in constant broils.

He was just in time to see two regiments of the provincials, without having fired a shot, flying before sixty or seventy of the British. He was beside himself at their cowardice; never did I see a man in such a towering rage. Regardless of the bullets that were whistling around him, he stood alone within eighty yards of the enemy, threatening the fugitives with sword and pistol, till one of his officers seized the bridle of his horse and dragged him from the field.

His appearance at Kip's Bay, despite the inevitable changes of years, recalled the last time I saw him, on that awful day of Braddock's defeat. We had fallen into the ambush on the Monongahela; the regulars were flying in every direction; men were being slaughtered like sheep. Washington, heedless that he was the target of all the best marksmen among those howling fiends, that his coat was riddled with bullets, and two horses had been shot from under him, refused to take to cover, lest his example unnerve his men, and towered through the smoke, the very incarnation of physical power. Seizing a field-piece as though it were a fagot, he brought it to bear on a body of French and Indians, and so, giving a momentary check to the attack, enabled us to beat a disorganized retreat.

On his subsequent journey to Massachusetts to hold conference with Governor Shirley regarding the military precedence, he tarried over night in New York, and Beverly Robinson, who was an old friend and schoolmate, gave a ball in his honor. The following morning, the young Virginian resumed his journey northward. As the gay little cavalcade clattered along the Battery, the company at Beverly's flocked to the gallery, to call good speed and fling flowers to the departing guests. A rose I know not from whose hand it fell - Washington deftly caught, and pressed to his lips. He rode a little in advance of the others, on a magnificent white charger, dressed in a uniform of blue and buff, with a scarlet and white cloak flung over his shoulder, and a sword knot of scarlet and gold at his side. As he passed out of sight, he waved his hand to us the hand still holding the rose; and so I have ever borne him in memory.

{"utterance": "Philip told me how she saved General\nWashington's life, knowing well what the cost\nwould be. All that night I heard his Excellency\npacing his room; even I, his most trusted\nfriend, dared not approach. Afterward, as you\nknow, when Colonel Philipse broke his parole\nand was attainted for treason, she was unjustly\nincluded in the sentence, and the Manor of\nPhilipsburgh was confiscated by Congress. I\nwas not behind General Washington in the\nendeavor to right the cruel wrong. Letter after\nletter was written; but in vain his Excellency\nexpostulated, urged, condemned; in vain I put\nhis representations into the strongest, most\nconvincing words at my command. I journeyed\nto Philadelphia to hold personal conference with\nCongress; but in its fatuity, its self-sufficiency,\nits bat-like opposition to every measure pro-\nposed by Washington, because, forsooth, they\nfancy him aiming at supreme power,- Miss\nPhilipse, the one woman out of the records of\nthe time, must stand, forever, as traitor!

And the dread\nof that fate amongst the negroes is so great\nthat they have to be carefully watched on\nthe boat to New York, lest they attempt self-\ndestruction.
