{"utterance": "Dear General, \u2014 As a member of the Com mittee on Military Affairs, it has come to my ears that you will before long swing loose from Atlanta and march across Georgia, either to Savannah or Augusta. Should my information be correct, I have a favor to ask of you. It is this : that, so far as is consistent with your duties as a soldier, you will protect the lives and property of the people whom you may find on the Abercrombie place in Middle Georgia. You cannot miss the place. Whether you go to Savannah or Augusta, it will be in your line of march. It is in the very heart of Georgia, and is known far and wide.\n I am not sure that the people I knew are liv ing there now ; but I am very sure that I spent some very happy and some very miserable days there. It was in the days of the years of my youth, and I should have been more miserable still but for the kindness of the people on that place.\n More than that, I owe them my life, which at one time I was on the point of losing at the hands of some of the neighborhood ruffians. Some day when we meet in Washington you shall have the particulars.\n You will find on that place, I trust \u2014 though he seemed too frail to five long \u2014 a youngster known as Little Crotchet. Say to him that I shall love him tenderly while life lasts. I hope you will also find there the kindly gentleman to whose patience and courtesy I owe many a pleasant hour. I hope, too, you will find Aaron there \u2014 Aaron the fugitive, who was and who remains a mystery.\n For the sake of these people and for the sake of old times, I venture to ask you to surround the place with such protection as may be consistent with duties which at this distance I can only have a vague conception of.\n Meanwhile, the few of us who have had hints of the adventure you are about to undertake are trembling with fear and hope. We confide in your genius, but we should be happier if we had already heard from you at the end of your jour ney. Faithfully yours,\n Kichakd Hudspeth.", "speaker": "the soldier who had come into the yard", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "grandfather and Aaron", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
