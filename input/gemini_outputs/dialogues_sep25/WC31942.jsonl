Not a flower has missed its appointed time of blossoming, or failed to perfect its fruit. No matter how hard has been the winter, how loud the winds have roared, and how high the snow-banks have been piled, all has come right again in spring. Not the least root has lost itself under the snows, so as not to be ready with its fresh leaves and blossoms when the sun returns to melt the frosty chains of winter. We have storms sometimes that threaten to shake everything to pieces, the thunder roars, the lightning flashes, and the winds howl and beat ; but, when all is past, everything comes out better and brighter than before, not a bird is killed, not the frailest flower destroyed. But man comes, and in one day he will make a desolation that centuries cannot repair. Ignorant boor that he is, and all incapable of appreciating the glorious works of Nature, it seems to be his glory to be able to destroy in a few hours what it was the work of ages to produce. The noble oak, that has been cut away to build this contemptible human dwelling, had a life older and wiser than that of any man in this country. That tree has seen generations of men come and go. It was a fresh young tree when Shakespeare was born ; it was hardly a middle-aged tree when he died ; it was growing here when the first ship brought the white men to our shores, and hundreds and hundreds of those whom they call bravest, wisest, strongest, warriors, states men, orators, and poets, have been born, have grown up, lived, and died, while yet it has outlived them all. It has seen more wisdom than the best of them ; but two or three hours of brutal strength sufficed to. lay it low. Which of these dolts could make a tree ? I 'd like to see them do anything like it. How noisy and clumsy are all their move ments, chopping, pounding, rasping, hammering ! And, after all, what do they build? In the forest we do every thing so quietly. A tree would be ashamed of itself that could not get its growth without making such a noise and dust and fuss. Our life is the perfection of good manners. For my part, I feel degraded at the mere presence of these human beings ; but, alas ! I am old ; a hollow place at my heart warns me of the progress of decay, and probably it will be seized upon by these rapacious creatures as an excuse for laying me as low as my noble green brother.\"", "speaker": "the old chestnut-tree", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "unspecified", "addressee_in_char_list": false}
