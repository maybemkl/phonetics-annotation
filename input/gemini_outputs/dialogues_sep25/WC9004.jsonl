When I found you pitied me, and listened to my love I was too weak to forego the one ray of sunshine in my wretched life and, thinking that I had a prospect before me in an idea I promised to reveal to you later, I swore never to beguile you or myself in that hope by any act that might bring you to repent it or myself to dishonor. But I taxed my- self too much, Maruja. I have asked too much of you. You are right, darling; this secrecy this deceit is unworthy of us! Every hour of it blest as it has been to me every moment sweet as it is blackens the purity of our only defense, makes you false and me a coward! It must end here to-day! Maruja, darling, my precious one! God knows what may be the success of my plans. We have but one chance now. I must leave here to-day, never to return, or I must take you with me. Do not start, Ma- ruja but hear me out. Dare you risk all? Dare you fly with me now, to-night, to the old Padre at the ruined Mision, and let him bind us in those bonds that none dare break? We can take Faquita with us it is but a few miles and we can return and throw ourselves at your mother's feet. She can only drive us forth together.

{"utterance": "I was at that time a sailor. I had been fool enough to run away from college, thinking it a fine romantic thing to ship before the mast for a voyage round the world. I was a little disappointed, perhaps, but I made the best of it, and in two years I was second mate of a whaler lying in a little harbor of one of the uncivilized islands of the Pacific. While we were at anchor there a French trading vessel put in, apparently for water. She had the dregs of a mixed crew of Lascars and Portuguese, who said they had lost the rest of their men by desertion, and that the captain and mate had been carried off by fever. There was something so queer in their story that our skipper took the law in his own hands, and put me on board of her with a salvage crew. But that night the French crew mutinied, cut the cables, and would have got to sea if we had not been armed and prepared, and managed to drive them below. When we had got them under hatches for a few hours they parleyed, and offered to go quietly ashore. As we were short of hands and unable to take them with us, and as we had no evidence against them, we let them go, took the ship to Callao, turned her over to the authorities, lodged a claim for salvage, and continued our voyage. When we returned we found the truth of the story was known. She had been a French trader from Marseilles, owned by her captain; her crew had mutinied in the Pacific, killed their officers and the only passenger the owner of the cargo. They had made away with the cargo and a treasure of nearly half a million of Spanish gold for trading purposes which belonged to the passenger. In course of time the ship was sold for sal- vage and put into the South American trade until the break- ing out of the Californian gold excitement, when she was sent with a cargo to San Francisco. That ship was the Pontiae which your father bought.", "speaker": "Mr. Renshaw", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Rosey Nott", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "I would say that you had purified her of all stains of her past but there may be one that remains. And that in most people's eyes would be no detraction. You look puz- zled, Miss Nott but I am coming to the explanation and the end of my story. A ship of war was sent to the island to punish the mutineers and pirates, for such they were, but they could not be found. A private expedition was sent to discover the treasure which they were supposed to have buried, but in vain. About two months ago Mr. Sleight told me one of his shipmates had sent him a Lascar sailor who had to dispose of a valuable secret regarding the Pon- tiae for a percentage. That secret was that the treasure was never taken by the mutineers out of the Pontiae ! They were about to land and bury it when we boarded them. They took advantage of their imprisonment under hatches to bury it in the ship. They hid it in the hold so securely and safely that it was never detected by us or the Callao authorities. I was then asked, as one who knew the vessel, to undertake a private examination of her, with a view of purchasing her from your father without awakening his suspicions. I assented. You have my confession now, Miss Nott. You know my crime. I am at your mercy.", "speaker": "Mr. Renshaw", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Rosey Nott", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
