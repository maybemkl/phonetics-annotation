You see, Rhoda, my daughter Diana-by the way, I have several more girls, Cynthia, Luna, Phoebe, and one or two more whose names I have forgotten; but Diana was the favorite. She was always rather a tom- boy, liking to play with bow and arrows, and run races and romp with the dogs, better than to read, or sew, or put the house in order. At last she took to going down to the earth almost every night; and the people who saw her were so pleased with her, that they built temples for her to live in, and gave her flowers and jewels, and flattered and praised her until the girl's head was fairly turned. She played all sorts of wild tricks upon her admirers. Why, there was a young man named Act\u00e6on,. who offended her in some way, and she turned him into a stag, and set his own dogs to chase him; they chased him right out of the world, and up here to the moon : they have not caught him yet, that I have heard of. After that, Diana fell in love with a young man called Endymion, and declared she would marry him. When I heard that, I thought it was high time to go and bring her home.

So I came home again, and sent my dog down next, and a half-a- dozen moonbeams with him. The dog was to find Diana, and the moonbeams to tell her that if she would come home, and bring Endymion, I would set them up at house-keeping, and all should be forgiven.

Then the other people, who never were troubled with fancies or ideas, call these poor stuffed people luna- tics-thinking that my daughter Luna has made them what they are, I suppose; and they shut them up in luna- tic asylums. Lunatics, indeed! If they only had gone to a writing-school when they were young, they would have been called geniuses, and nothing could have been too good for them. Sometimes the moonbeams pour in ideas faster than the brain can arrange or put them together, even if the person does write them down, and then they make queer work enough of it for a while, but finally join the lunatics.

{"utterance": "Why, I was saying that after Whittington left London with his cat in his arms, and stopped under the tree to hear Bow-bells ring out 'Turn again, Whitting- ton, Lord Mayor of London,' he went to sea; but instead of landing in a savage country, as the story says, he got shipwrecked, and floated about the ocean on a raft, he and his cat together, until, while he was fast asleep one night, his raft got into a moonglade, and when Richard awoke he was in the moon. He did not know it, however, and nobody took the pains to tell him. I doubt if he ever found it out. While wandering about, soon after his arrival, he came upon the Cheese Mine. Being rather hungry, he asked if he might go down and dig his luncheon for himself. The miners told him that nobody could go into the mine, on account of the rats and mice who had taken possession of it, and who would eat a man as quick as they would a candle, if he came in their way.", "speaker": "the Chimney-Elf", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Rhoda", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Pooh! if that is all, I will send Bow-bells down first, and he will soon clear the way.' Bow-bells, you understand, was the name of the cat, given him in honor of the handsome promise that had recalled Whittington to London. But when the miners understood him, they all cried out, No, no! that won't do; for what will the Marquis of Carabas say?", "speaker": "the Chimney-Elf", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Rhoda", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "That was the name of Puss in Boots.", "speaker": "Rhoda", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "the Chimney-Elf", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Yes. And, as the miners explained to Whittington, Puss in Boots, after he had grown rich and got his title, became very proud and lazy; the more good fortune that befel him, the more he wanted-like some other people. Among the rest of his privileges, he had obtained that of keeping all the rats and mice in the Cheese Mine for his own pleasure and use; so that when he fancied to go hunting, either alone or with his friends, he might always know where to find plenty of game. A very nice arrangement for the Marquis of Carabas, you see; but not so nice for the poor people whose cheese the rats and mice lived upon while waiting for the Marquis to come and kill them. Well, the miners explained all this to Whitting- ton, and to Bow-bells, who stood listening, with his back very much arched, and his upper lip quivering away from his sharp white teeth. When they had heard the whole story, Whittington laughed aloud, and stooping to smooth Bow-bells' rounded back, he said:", "speaker": "the Chimney-Elf", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Rhoda", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Why, that's all nonsense. Puss in Boots has no right to keep rats and mice to eat up other people's cheese; and what's more, he shan't do it. Shall he, Bow-bells ?", "speaker": "Richard Whittington", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Bow-bells", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Bow-bells gave a miau of defiance that sent every mouse in the mine to his hole for shelter. Then he went down among them-and such havoc as he made! All the galleries were choked with the bodies of the slain, and the whole neighboring country was overrun with the fugitives who managed to escape. Not a rat, not a mouse was left to show his tail.", "speaker": "the Chimney-Elf", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Rhoda", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Bow-bells had finished the battle, and was just sit- ting down to lick his paws clean, when a message was brought that the Marquis of Carabas desired the pres- ence of the cat and the man who had invaded his domain, and meddled with the game sacred to his use.", "speaker": "the Chimney-Elf", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Rhoda", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Whittington, after consulting Bow-bells, replied that if the Marquis of Carabas wished to see either cat or man, he must come to them, as they were too busy to go to him.", "speaker": "the Chimney-Elf", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Rhoda", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Bow-bells beat, as might have been expected, for the Mar- quis of Carabas had almost for- gotten how to fight, and had be- come very fat and lazy since he came to his fortune, having no need to hunt, except for amusement. Bow-bells beat, and the Marquis was very glad to come to terms. He agreed henceforth to allow him to kill as many rats and mice as he wanted; to live in the Cheese Mine as long as he chose; in fact, to do exactly as he pleased, so long as he would allow the Marquis of Carabas to creep away home, with ragged ears, and great patches torn out of his sleek velvet coat.", "speaker": "the Chimney-Elf", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Rhoda", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Bow-bells, having always been poor, and obliged to earn his own living, did not know how to spend his time in indolence, but just kept on with his work until the Cheese Mine was entirely cleared of mice, both living and dead; for the former he drove away, and the latter he devoured.", "speaker": "the Chimney-Elf", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Rhoda", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "For this service, the Man in the Moon presented him with a vote of thanks, and a silver tea-set. To the first, Bow-bells replied, Miau! and as for the second, he suggested that a handsome sum of money given to his master, and a free passage for both of them back to earth, would be much more to the purpose. The Man in the Moon held a council, and concluded to do as he was requested, although quite sure that his own plan was the best. So they gave Whittington a bag- ful of gold, and sent him back upon the next moon- glade to the earth-the moonbean who conducted him taking the precaution to steal the memory of his visit out of his head while he was asleep, lest he should make the secrets of the moon common and vulgar. The cat remembered it all well enough, but along with the memory of his visit, Whittington lost the power of understanding Bow-bells' language, and even the knowl- edge that he had a language; so that, although almost any cat you meet could tell you the story of Bow-bells' duel with the Marquis of Carabas, there is not a man, woman, or child on earth who ever heard it, or who knows the true origin of Whittington's fortune.

In some places, every man has his cheese-cellar in his own yard, and when he wants a piece, just steps down and' cuts it out of the wall. Now, there's the Little Boy that lived by himself--I dare say you have heard of him; he mines his own cheese, and we will step up and see him.

{"utterance": "Why, it happened this way, Rhoda. When I was young, I was quite small, so that they used to call me Little Boy; and in fact, they do so now. But after father and mother died, I lived here by myself, and kept house the best way I knew how. I've got a cheese-cellar out here, and I made my own bread and such things. When I had finished a meal, I'd just put the bread and cheese on a shelf in the kitchen; after a while, though, the rats and the mice that Bow-bells sent wandering all over the moon, found me out, and I had no peace day nor night from them. At last, one day, as I was laying about me with a broomstick, trying to kill or drive away a few of my tormentors, Baron Bluebeard, who was riding by, stopped to see what was the mat- ter; for I suppose I made a good deal of noise. When I had explained the case to him, he smiled horribly, and said:", "speaker": "Little Boy", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Rhoda", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "Then he rode on, and I sat down to think of his advice. It seemed to me pretty good; and the next time I went to Moonopolis, I asked Lydia Locket to marry me. She agreed, in case she found her pocket before the wedding. While we were still talking, Kitty Fisher stepped in to say that she had found it. The only trouble then was, that the Lockets lived in the very middle of the city, and the lanes were so narrow that no coach could get into them, although some of the streets were ridiculously wide. The only way seemed to be for me to bring my wife home in a wheel-barrow; for of course the Lockets, who are very smart people, would not let a daughter of theirs walk to her wedding.", "speaker": "Little Boy", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Rhoda", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "Not much that was worth keeping, my dear. Only a little of your childish gayety, and content with common things, and a good deal of time and some little health. I believe that is about all.\nI am sure the spectacles have more than paid you. But it is about time for you to get some new ones. What do you say to a pair that will make the Widow Merriam, whom your father is to marry, look like a mother to you; and show you your sister Susy's lover, Jonas Merton, in a pleasanter light than you have seen him yet; and make your own home seem like a palace, or something better than a palace to you, and\u2014", "speaker": "the fairy godmother", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Rhoda", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "They will cost you some of your self-will, some selfishness, some pride, and a good deal of trouble, my dear.

{"utterance": "No, you can't feel them!\nNobody knows whether they wear fairy spectacles or not; and it is one of the best jokes I know, to hear people praise their own clear-sightedness, and boast how far into a mill-stone it will carry them, when all the time, bless you, it is nothing but my glasses.", "speaker": "the fairy godmother", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Rhoda", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
