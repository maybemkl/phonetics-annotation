I have riot written before in answer to it, because, in fact, the letter did not seem to require an answer, and because the young man seemed to be doing so well as to make it superfluous to send you any report of him. Within a few days, however, such a painful rumor has reached my ears that I cannot feel myself justified in letting you remain in ignorance of it. When I speak of rumor, I must add that it is not of mere report I speak ; but before writing I have taken pains to verify the story, and not to distress you unneces sarily.\n  You will remember that last summer your son and a companion went off on a walking expedition during the vacation. Their journey did not ex tend very far. I am told that they, or at least he, did not go farther than Maiden, a small farming village about twelve miles from here, and there spent the entire three weeks. He has, I believe, been there at various times during the autumn.\n  Latterly, I have noticed in him an unusual ap plication to study, and a gravity, I might almost say anxiety. I know very little of the lives of the young men, and am not thrown at all with them except in the lecture-room, and I knew nothing of this matter till it had become town talk, and of", "speaker": "Professor Smythe", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mr. Crittenden", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

She is the daughter of a widow, and has no brother or near male relative, or I suppose there would have been some scene of violence. According to the popular idea, however, this only makes the worse case against him. I must add, I understand the young woman to have borne a good character hitherto, and to belong to an entirely respectable family, though in very humble circum stances.\n  I need not say, my dear Crittenden, how pain ful it has been to me to write of this to you, but I have felt it my duty to let you know the facts. You will understand enough of life in a small town to know that it is not wise for him to re main longer here, and I fancy, by withdrawing him at once and quietly, the scandal of an expulsion can be avoided. You know you may command my friendship in the matter to the utmost.\n I am yours faithfully,\n  ERASTUS B.

It fills me with dismay. I wish I could see any other way out of it, but, Edward, there is none. He must marry her ; he must do what is right. We must trust Heaven for the rest. Suffering is better than sin. This is a heavy bur den ; but what would be the burden of a wrong unrighted, a debt uncanceled, all through our lives, tainting everything ?

There was such a large meet  ing, everybody was there. I looked around for  you.' At that Sue and Fanny colored up, and I\nsaw Fanny give him a look, and he got so con  fused.

Everybody was going, they said, so glad  of something else to talk about ; and then I got  away before they could ask me if we were going.\nI think Fred wanted to walk home with me, but I  would n't look at him, I would n't let him come  near me.

I shall never get near  enough to Barry to ask him ; he will never of his  own will approach anything so painful. Some  times I think he never could have left her, there  is so much to make her beloved ; then, again, I  watch in vain for any sign of the lover. I appeal  in vain to my knowledge of human nature. Barry  is a sealed book to me in these days. I don't  know whether he is one of those men to whom  love is impossible without respect, or whether the  tenderness of his early passion would cover the  frailty of virtue that to most men is unpardona  ble. All experience is against the probability of a  man's valuing what is forced upon him. And yet  he had an alternative ; he was not forced into it. It was made possible for him to go away. On the  other hand, did he do it from duty, from the  sort of conviction that you and I have, Lucy ? Your father would tell me that such a view of  duty is just a woman's notion : and we have never  thought Barry likely to take a woman's view of  duty ; happy if he took a man's ! No, my child,  it 's all a riddle to me. I can only watch with a  sore heart the working out of what with perhaps  rash assurance I at first said was the right thing  to do. Your father is against me in it, and every  day hardens his convictions and weakens mine. I  have put it out of my power to win Phoebe's  confidence, by my unhappy failure of charity  when her wretched mother came to me. I am her  enemy, and I am not Barry's friend, apparently. I have spoiled life for you and Honor, and the  courage of my convictions seems to have left me  just when I needed it most. You must help me,  Lucy, help me, and forgive me if I have done  you and Honor harm. God knows nobody ever  meant to do right more earnestly.

{"utterance": "What should you say, Phoebe, if I went away  for a little while ? Could Master Baby take care  of you for a matter of six weeks or two months ? He looks to me capable of it. Let me tell you all  about it. We 've had a certain turn of things at  the office. These railroad matters have occupied  my father pretty closely, and a telegram yesterday  settled it that he 's got to go across. Then came  the worry about leaving my mother and the girls. Going abroad is what they 've all been longing  for, for years, here was the chance. Mamma  had a thousand minds about it, but Honor only  one, and I believe Lucy was ' unanimous ! ' So  the fact is, I 've been racing over town all day  like mad, have arranged everything: given up  their apartments, got state-rooms, written letters,  settled matters at the office, and done the work of  twenty able-bodied men. Father growls, but I  think he likes the idea, and there is n't a doubt  but that the change will do them all good. They  had got in a rut, and the girls would have a beast  of a time this summer if they stayed at home.", "speaker": "Barry", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Phoebe", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "Oh, well, I had n't got there yet. You see  this is the way it stands. If I don't go with them  my father 's got to come back at once. If I go I  can take the first steamer home after it 's settled,  bring back the papers, and attend to the matter  at this end of the line, and leave him to a holiday  of several months. There is enough there to re  quire his attention and to give him a feeling that  he 's right to stay ; in fact, if he did n't stay I 'd  have to. Somebody 's got to be on hand there as  well as here. You see, it 's an important matter,  and we have just got to give up our individual in  terests, and take hold of it. I don't like to ask  you, Phoebe, to stay so long alone, but I don't see  how it can be helped. I 've thought it over on all  sides. It seems the best arrangement I can make. Father needs the rest. It would be hard on him,  at his age, to make that voyage and come directly  back, and probably have to go again in six weeks' time. Whereas if I go with him, get all the ins  and outs of the matter the little while I 'm there,  and come back, I can intelligently conduct the  case here, and bring things to a successful issue. There 's a good deal of money in it and a good  deal of glory, and I like to feel my father trusts  me enough to leave things on this side to me. It 's  just the place where, if I hung back on the score  of leaving you, he could reproach me with my  marriage.

I know  I went away to Europe selfishly ; it was not the  thing for me to go, leaving you so lonely. But  when I came back and I 'd been counting the  days you could not forgive me. You were as  cold as ice. You threw me back so. I was trying  to find some reason for it. I have seen that I  found the wrong one. I ask your forgiveness for  being jealous of Peyton.

What I said that morning was unjusti  fiable, but I thought you might have put it down  to the right cause. I have felt bitter and resent  ful, Phoebe, and have only come back because I  can't keep away, because I love you so much I  can't be happy without you. I have felt bitter  and resentful that you could be so unrelenting for  so small an injury. For a hasty word, it isn't  quite the thing to ruin a man's home and break  up everything.
