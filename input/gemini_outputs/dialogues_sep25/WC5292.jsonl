Truly, I know my business ! The whip is the school- master of the negro ; it humbles, it educates, it saves, it subjugates bim to man. Cotton is King-a purple and bloody king. Yonder thun- derous artilery at Hilton Head is to prove to the world that Cotton is King. There could be no king if there were no cotton; and if there were no negroes, there could be no cotton. Verily, friend Roscoe, let us shout, with a loud voice : \u2022 Long live Cotton ! long live the Black Saxops! Pardon this interruption, friend planter, and go straight on with thy wooing.
