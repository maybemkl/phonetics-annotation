If your husband had lived, I should never have thought of giving up the children, no matter what had happened. I am sure it will cost me hard to leave them that I have brought up. They are like my own to me. But if they were my own, they would not keep me, if I once made up my mind to go. You may make what arrangements you think best for yourself and for the children. I have made up my mind to one thing, either that man stops coming to this house, or I go out of it. I will mind your children and do my duty by the house as I have always done, for their sakes, and for their poor dead father's, if this thing is put a stop to, here and now. You can choose your choice. But I cannot, and I will not, see those children that I have nursed so long brought to disgrace and shame by a heartless mother. I will not see it, I say. I will go away and hide myself and try to forget it all. It is enough that this thing is the talk of all the village.

Poor babies, they would be better in their coffins, where they would have been, if you had had the care of them. A woman that can forget a man like that, and take up with such a one as this, what right has she to have the care of children? A wild Irishman, turning somersaults in the village streets, shouting his songs and non- sense in the ears of decent, quiet people, that's a man for a lady to take up with. Folks say they don't know even what his name is; it's handy to have two or three, sometimes, I've heard. He's likely to have need of all he's got. The Emlyns will be sick of him, perhaps, sometime. He gets a little money now from teaching, but where'll the next bit come from, I should like to know. I suppose he thinks he knows, and that he's sure of a shelter and a crust if he plays a good sharp game, down here. But remember, now's your time to choose. I'll only wait another day to have this matter settled, and know exactly what you have made up your mind to do.

He's given Ned his gun, and me some books. He's just as nice as ever. He tries to talk the same and be like himself, but it isn't natural, and his face is so pale, and his eyes so hol- low. The chambermaid says he didn't go to bed at all, but just walked about his room all night. At break- fast it was horrid. He couldn't eat anything, though he took lots of things on his plate.

{"utterance": "Gentlemen, this case has been cruelly prejudged and falsified; when I have shown you all, I think you will agree with me. Let me begin by putting before you the theory of the prosecution, and by pointing out a few of its weak points. You are asked to believe that this man before you has murdered the innocent. and beauti- ful children of the woman whom he loved, because he was persuaded that they stood between him and the at- tainment of her hand. They represent him to you as sane, as resolute; they do not even ask you to believe it was in transport of rage, because, sometimes, one is sorry for a man whose sufferings drive him to extremity, and because high-tempered jurymen might have some sym- pathy for such a one. No, he has done it deliberately, he has plotted and planned, he is a devil in man's shape; he has belied all that has been known of him, all hie goodness and lightheartedness; he commits this mon- strous crime, and he goes away, meaning, forsooth, to come back and marry the mother when her days of mourning shall be ended. Gentlemen, I won't affront your intelligence by much dwelling on a theory like this. One asks naturally for a motive for the commis- sion of such a crime. There was every motive that he should not commit it. The prosecution declares that she returned his affection; that perhaps his poverty and her desire to devote her means and all her time to the care and education of these children, prevented her from marrying him. If her affection for them living was too great to be overcome by all his passion, what would her love for them be, dead by such a cruel death as this?", "speaker": "Mr. Hardinge", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "the jurors", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

The prisoner is shown to you, by the testimony of all the witnesses, even the woman Sophia, as uni- formly gentle, gentlemanly, affectionate to children, tender-hearted, keenly averse to giving pain; it was impossible from his temperament for him to have done this deed. The mother of these children trusted him, enjoyed his society; 'I was glad to have him for my friend,' she says, in her testimony. I should believe she was a woman not easily deceived; her instincts are fine; she has keen, womanly discernment. What if she cannot love him? Love comes unsought, unsent.' Perhaps her heart is in the grave. She cannot return his affection; she has to deal this blow, but you may be sure she does it gently. Let us look at the character of the woman Sophia. She loves her mistress-apparently most people love her who come near her-but she is consumed with a jealous hatred of the young tutor; she sees in him a suitor from the first.

The prisoner, having said his last good-bye to the mother, just on the threshold turns back, and says: 'Mayn't I go in and look at the children before I go?' Their room is on the same floor. He knows the ways about the quaint little cottage; he goes in to give them a good-bye kiss, for he is going from America forever on the morrow. The hands of the clock point at five minutes before nine; the lady notices it, the maid no- tices it; they think that he will miss his train. They are both within call. Fancy him going through that deadly work, not knowing at what instant the nurse's black eyes may gleam in upon him! He has three minutes to make sure that both are dead. He comes out cool and steady, passes through the hall, past the mother, past the stealthy nurse, out into the street, and takes his way coolly to the train, to miss which is to meet death.

I shouldn't like to call it anything else; the counsel's a stranger in these parts, and he's anxious we should be particularly good to strangers. He quotes the Bible about it, you know. Well, we'll call it a flight of fancy. That poor, stupid Dutchman, who was seen around that day by several witnesses, had about as much to do with the murder as my dog Major had. Now, that lane from Old Town Pond is a highway in everything but name. You all know as well as I do, people go across there every day in the week without being bound to the Detmold farm-house; I suppose we must call it the cot- tage now-quaint little cottage, and all that sort of thing. It's a mighty damp, rickety, old farm-house, in point of fact, but since it's been occupied by city people, it's politer to say it is a cottage. The folks that have been in it this year must have got used to having foot pas- sengers going through the yard, night and day. The place was shut up so long, everybody got in the habit of going along that way from Wickapogue and thereabouts; it cuts off half a mile or so. The tramp had as good a right as anybody to go through (that was no right at all, but he'd be as likely as any one to take it). He went through, most likely, when the fam- ily were in at tea, or maybe he struck off to the village through the fields before he got to the farm-yard. Again, the motive of the tramp was burglary, and no burglary has been committed; a footstool has been overturned and a couple of worthless articles are miss- ing. We won't waste time over that.

You don't expect a poor Shinnecock half- breed to stand up against a city lawyer's befogging questions. On the cross-examination she contradicted herself, as any one of her gauge of intellect would do. She shut that kitchen door and bolted it; she would have done it by force of habit, if she had been fast asleep. Sophia trusted her, and that shows she'd never failed to shut it up before. The lower part of that house was shut off from communication with the upper, as fast as bars and bolts could make it. A noisy little 283 poodle, who never let a stranger enter the gate without barking himself into fits, lay silent on the rug, and never lifted up his voice. The rear was all secure; the front was guarded by two wakeful women, in full possession of their faculties. Gentlemen of the jury, nobody got into that house from the rear that night; you know it as well as I know it, notwithstanding this distinguished lawyer's flight of fancy. Who got in from the front, and how did he get in? You have heard the story so many times, it's scarcely worth while to tell it all again. Bernard Macnally, or the man that's passed among us by that name, was the last person to go into that room where the children lay. No other person could have got in, no other person did get in; it wasn't prejudging the murderer, when the work was seen, to say whose work it was.

He knew he could do it; he had done as risky things before. He is a man of force, there's no denying that. He knew this widow loved him; I don't want to say anything against her, but she doesn't come quite up to our notion of good conduct in this county, if she let him be hanging round her all sum- mer in the way she did, if she didn't want to marry him, that's all. But she did want to marry him. The only thing in the way was the children. She hadn't money enough to support this gay young gentleman, and do justice to the children, too. I've no doubt she got a little good advice from Sophia Atkinson.

I should have thought he would have been thinking about nothing but that. But he asks to go and see the children, too. He goes in, by the only entrance one could get in, to the nursery. When he comes out, Sophia sees him. He looks white and bad; he walks past the mother of the children without a word; he doesn't offer to touch her hand. I shouldn't think he would! He goes away; he knows he has time. He trusts to luck; he's had pretty good luck so far in his ex- ploits, perhaps. He is a cool hand, remember. It needn't surprise us that he shows no fright and nervousness till he is arrested. We may know all about that sort of thing if we will look over the police reports. I contend this man, of whom we know nothing, absolutely nothing, till ten months ago, is a member of what we call the criminal class. It isn't a small class either, if we are to believe all the reports. We live in the country, and it is hard to believe in such depravity. I could cite you twenty cases that I have come across in my reading, that have in them a great deal that is parallel.

{"utterance": "But, in many ways, this case has narrowed down to a contest between two witnesses. If you believe Sophia Atkinson, you believe there was no possibility for any one to enter the rear of the house. If you be- lieve her mistress, you are forced to admit there was. If you believe, again, this latter, you believe some one went out the gate, meaning to get away without at- tracting observation. If you believe Sophia, you be- lieve no one could have done it without her quick ears hearing them go out. The counsel for the defence. says you mustn't believe Sophia, because she listened, and because she kept that handkerchief with half the alphabet embroidered on it. Oh, yes! and because she didn't like the prisoner from the first, and thought him a bad lot. Well, do you know, it strikes me those are just three counts on which you ought to trust her. I don't blame her for listening. Her mistress was young; she had been her nurse before she was her children's nurse; she saw she was being entrapped by a bad fellow; she watched day and night to save her. The handkerchief (which, gentlemen, is one of a set found in the prisoner's trunk) was something tangible to show he wasn't Bernard Macnally, no matter if he was a perfect gentleman, and all that sort of thing. She kept it in a safe place, till she could use it to con- vince the younger woman of the mistake that she was making. And I don't blame her very much for not liking him from the very first. I think it's to the credit of her judgment that she didn't. An intelligent American woman of her age, who has been trusted all her life by the family that she's lived with, can't be pooh-poohed off the witness-stand by the flight of fancy of even a distinguished lawyer from the city. Sophia Atkinson is the sort of witness I like; she's the sort of woman I like; I'd like her in my family. If she's ever out of place, I hope she'll remember my ad- dress.

Perhaps I'm not as easily overcome by personal attractions as he is; we don't think so much about things of that kind in the country, maybe, after we marry and settle down. But I must say, there are things I don't understand. That gate, for instance-why didn't Sophia hear it? She was almost as near. It came in so pat, that gate. It was a god- send to the defence. I don't know where the defence would have gone to have hunted up a theory but for the lifting of that gate-latch. Then that bolt on the. door of the kitchen stairs. It's remarkable the lady should have remembered it so long-just that little cir- cumstance. It wasn't as if she was shutting up the house herself; it wasn't as if anybody had suggested, for days after the murder, that it was of the least im- portance in the case. Her remembering it so very clearly is a thing that-well, that I can't understand exactly. Only on one theory. Now, don't be shocked, gentlemen. I don't want to be impolite.

The law knows a woman can't be trusted to tell the truth when it comes to hurting a hair of the man's head that she loves. Now, I don't pretend to say this lady knows she has-well-misstated facts a little. I don't say she would deliberately say what wasn't strictly true. But she wants it to be true so dreadfully; she thinks about it, and thinks about it, and ends up in believing it herself. You can't trust a woman in love; there's no way out of that. It introduces a nice moral question. It's just the sort of thing my brother for the defence could spread out, till you didn't know head from tail of it. It isn't in my line, you see.

Once establish that a man accused of any crime has walked a steady, straight road in the sight of all men for a lifetime, and you've as good as cleared him. A man's life, I say again, goes for a good deal, and it ought to go for a good deal. Men don't break out all of a sudden into murderers and thieves. It doesn't come upon 'em like the small-pox, unless they've had it in their system. Now, gentlemen, let's look at this man before us. Ten months ago, he rose out of the earth, or dropped down from the sky, into the Emlyn family. Colonel Emlyn,-now, I've a great respect for Colonel Emlyn, he's a neighbor of mine, and we get along first-rate together-but I wouldn't set him to take care of my family exactly. He adver- tises for a tutor, and along comes this one. He is a taking young fellow; he talks the colonel into engaging him without a word of reference. He doesn't know whether he dropped from the sky, as I say, or burrowed his way out from the ground. He doesn't ask. He takes him. He brings him home, makes him one of the family. In fact, I don't know but he makes him. 289 the most important member of his family.

Things are talked of freely-their fam- ily connections, what they did last year and the year before, what they're going to do next year. Does he return the compliment? Not a bit of it. He talks enough, Heaven knows, but he's exceedingly care- ful not to talk about himself. At the end of ten months, the people he's been living with can't tell you, though they rack their memory to do it, of a single word that he has dropped about his home, his people, his life before he came to them. They don't know\u2014anything about him. They're ladies and gen- tlemen, and they don't pry into what he doesn't choose to tell them. The best they can say is that they found him reticent. Reticent! Well, he's the first Irishman I ever knew that was, even about his debts, and the bad whisky that he'd drunk, and the bad morals of his grandmother. No, gentlemen, he isn't a common Irish- man, he's an uncommon Irishman; if he wasn't, we'd have had an immigration law that would have kept him out a good many years ago. This man, Irishman as he was, knew how to hold his tongue. Here, at the foot of the gallows, he knows how to hold it still. These kind and hospitable people never got him to betray a word, in all the familiarity of every-day life. He could make jokes, and turn somersaults, and quote Greek and Latin, and shoot and fish, and play with the children, and Sophia tells you he make love to the widow; but he couldn't tell them 'iver a ward' about himself. They tell you he was amiable. Of course. Why shouldn't he be? Even didn't bang the children about and complain of the biscuits when he came to tea. I shouldn't have supposed he would.

If he can't let you look back into his life more'n ten months, it's a pity, greater still. The counsel for the defence gives us dex- terously to understand, he is of a very fine family. Well, I'm sure I don't say that he isn't. I'm not much posted on the ways of fine families on the other side; but all I can say is, if they're all of 'em given to turn- ing somersaults, climbing poles, going about barelegged, driving through the streets with warming pans over their shoulders, I'm sure I'm glad they don't emigrate to this country in any greater numbers.

It was not through any neglect of those engaged in the prosecution, that it did not come to light before. It was, I am ashamed to say, due to the connivance of the officer who arrested the prisoner, that this important link in the chain of evidence was not supplied to us before. The officer is, as you remember, an Irishman; his sympathy for his countryman was greater than his sense of duty. As this miscarriage is due in no way to the prosecution, and that the ends of justice may not be defeated, I ask permission to offer this evidence now. I have the man's affidavit, and the corroborating testimony ready. It will not detain you many minutes, and I ask permission to proceed.

If it had come in the regular course of the case, no one would have given it a second thought. It proves nothing. It fits in to nothing. When I said yesterday, that when those articles were found we should have found the murderer, I meant, and the counsel knows I meant, when we found them in the possession of a burglar. Your Honor, this man is not a burglar; the prosecution doesn't present him as a burglar. His having that shoe doesn't prove anything but his affection for the little child that wore it.

If it was law yesterday, it must be law to-day. I can't turn and twist about so quick as all that. I believed him yesterday. I keep on believing him.

If, guilty, he should escape, the law, and not the administrators of it, would have to bear the blame. If, innocent, he should be saved, the law could alone be lauded. It has passed out of our hands; for or against, we have done our best; all human effort is sealed now forever; if that testimony is admitted, the law is violated. A trust has been betrayed; the divine character of justice has been sullied. We are but human; we can see but a little way. We must work within narrow rules, and then trust that they will develop the Divine Will and order. I would never stand at the bar, to plead for or against a fellow-mortal's life, if I did not believe in Divine Justice working through human agency, humble and imperfect, but struggling on through generations of honest effort, to break a channel for the truth.

'Leonard Conyngham was born about the year 18- (why can't they be accurate on a point so vital!) on the family estate, near Mallow. (I wonder in what part of Great Britain Mallow is. I must look it up on the map.) He is one of a large family; one brother has distinguished himself in the army, another in the navy. A third is a prominent barrister. Two of his sisters have married into the nobility, one being the wife of Lord Massy, and another married to Sir Gerald Austen.' (Sophia, do you hear that!

{"utterance": "It will be seen by this, that our illustrious visitor is entitled to the highest social consideration, entirely apart from his distinction as a man of letters and an orator. The suddenness with which he attained his present height of popularity may be accounted for by a little retrospect. These particulars have been fur- nished us by one well acquainted with his family history, and may be relied on as entirely accurate. Young Leonard showed very little of the genius which has since distinguished him during boyhood and early youth. He graduated at Dublin University without much distinction as a scholar. (Why Dublin Uni- versity? I should have preferred Oxford, it seems to me, if I had been a 'landed gentry.') His family were anxious that he should enter the church, for which he had been designed from childhood. This he refused, and an estrangement from them was the result. He then threw himself into some political movement, with more generosity of spirit than worldly wisdom. The country was in its usual disturbed state; his party was unsuccessful in its attempt; he was obliged to flee the country, and for several years his family were in great anxiety about him. About seven years ago he returned from Australia, where he had been laying up the stores of experience and adventure from which he feeds his marvelous fancy. He then resumed his place at home, and devoted himself to the study of the law. But it may easily be guessed he did not stay long in bondage to this exacting mistress. He was meant for higher things than pleadings and practice. The publication of his first book took the public by storm. His maiden speech in Parliament, to which he had been returned, was equally a bomb-shell. Two such gifts are rarely allotted to any one man. At once an orator who can thrill crowds with the fire and eloquence of his tongue, and a writer, who can hold them with the inagic subtlety of his pen, we do not hesitate in saying, Leonard Conyngham stands foremost among the younger men of the nineteenth century, and has before him a future which can only be limited by his own failure of will and steady purpose.'

Hear this: 'He is rather slender, below middle height. His hair is dark, his eyes are very brilliant, rather deep-set. His expression is one of profound melancholy.' Think of that, Sophia. What if he ha dyspepsia? Perhaps the biscuits don't agree with him. Fancy if you are anyway responsible for that profound melancholy. Don't you think you'd better speak to the cook about it?
