So when we Northern people set our slaves free, the men down there said, ' They won't work if we give them liberty, and we can't do without them.' ' Yes, but it is wrong for one man to own another,' said we. Then they tried to persuade themselves it wasn't. At last they really declared it was right ; their ministers preached on the righteousness of slavery, and tried to prove it from the Bible. Now, you know, Maedy, when you run down hill, you go faster and faster ; and so it is with people who do wrong ; unless they stop suddenly, they do it more and more \u2014 always faster. In the South they ill-treated men who opposed slavery. Some were put in prison, others were tormented and killed. The masters became more cruel to their slaves, and more quarrelsome with us, till at last a number of them came together and said, 1 Let us live by ourselves ; we'll make a nation of our own ; then we can keep our slaves without trouble, and do what we like with them. To be sure, we must break oar oath to defend the United States Government. We must rob it of land, money, forts, guns, everything we can for our new nation ; but never mind, we'll try it' So they began. They had muskets sent South, and United States soldiers sent North. Those of the slavery men who were Senators at Washington deserted their places ; some of them, such as Jeffer son Davis, President of the so-called Con federacy, now hold office in their pretended Government. These men worked with all their might to force the Southern States out of the Union. But you may be sure the patriotic people in the North were not asleep all this time.

Rebel pickets were -within call, while I,  creeping on all fours, hunted up and down the bank  for the boat I had hidden ten days before. Every cry  of a bird or plunge of a fish made me think of the  papers I carried, and the rope that would swing  me in the air if a rebel should set eyes on me. 'Twan't no use to hunt for the boat. I'd lost my bear ings \u2014 knew no more -where I was, than a squirrel that's  gone to sleep for the winter. You've jes' got to  lay down and float on the current, says I to myself. There's no help for it ; them northern pickets must be  reached afore sunrise or you'll be a-swingin' from a limb  of this Black Forest. Jes' then, as I was a standin' in the water, up to my waist, I heerd the low baying  of a blood-hound. It sounded kinder good now, and  no mistake ! After having all sorts of fears, alone  there in the dark on the great river, 'twas relieving to  know for certain what one of the dangers was. I crept  along down stream, the beast growling all the time  beside me on shore, when something struck me in the  breast, and I couldn't hinder a little shout as I grasped  the gunwale of my boat moored under the bank. \"What  with a-stiflin' the noise I was half choked, but scrambled  in and set to hunting tor the painter in the bow to let  her loose. All of a sudden out shone the moon \u2014 the  first light that had beamed through all that black  night \u2014 and right there on the log from which I had  just unmoored the boat, crouched the bloodhound,  poising for the spring. I saw his eyes, red as flames,  and his open jaws ; the next instant the boat shot into  the stream, the creetur' after it. I tried to hit him on  the head with an oar, but he dodged. My craft  careened over, and he tried desperately to get his fore paws over the side, but only managed to clinch the  gunwale with his teeth. \u2022 Now or never you villain,' I  muttered under breath, and put the muzzle of my re volver between his eyes ; but just then I thought of the  pickets on shore. The noise of my pistol might send  a volley of rebel shots after me. The hound still hung  to the boat, and all the time the water rushing over  her side a3 if 'twould swamp her. I threw down  the pistol and hauled out my ' Bowie ' sharp and shining. It went clear through brawn and muscle to the nape  of the brute's neck. He leaped half way out the water  and then sank out of sight. Ten minutes pull brought  me over the stream, and an hour afterward I delivered  my papers.

For a mile and a half in going by the forts  the firing was continuous, as you can  imagine, from the fact that about fifty  missiles fell into each fort every moment. The wonder is that the rebel garrison could  endure so long ; for one shell can easily  harm a score of lives, and there for five  hours shot and shell poured in on them  like a shower of hail. At the end of  that time we saw a boat lowered from  the flag-ship, bearing a flag of truce in  the bow, and our own banner in the  stern ; we supposed, then, that the re bels had struck their colors, and sure  enough, a litle later, the true flag shone  like a flame in the air, and the bands crashed  in magnificently with the ' Star Spangled  Banner.' The rebels had fled in haste, as  we found upon landing. Everything was  in confusion inside the fort ; and the meadows  beyond were strewn with clothes, arms, and  fragments of all kinds.
