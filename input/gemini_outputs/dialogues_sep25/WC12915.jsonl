There isn't a squarer man or sounder soldier in the army than the adjutant of the Riflers; and he said that it was Hayne's stubborn pride that more than anything else stood in the way of his restoration to social standing. He had made it a rule that every one who was not for him, was against him, and refused to admit any man to his society who would not first come to him of his own volition and say he believed him utterly innocent.

I think that where a man has been convicted of dishonorable disgraceful conduct and is cut by his whole regiment it is our business to back the regiment, not the man. Now the question is, where shall we draw the line in this case? It's none of our funeral, as Blake says, but ordinarily it would be our duty to call upon this officer.

So far as I can learn, he is a far more reputable character than I am, and a better officer than most of us. Growl all you want to, comrades mine: 'it's a way we have in the army,' and I like it. So long as I include myself in these malodorous comparisons, you needn't swear. It is my conviction that the Riflers wouldn't say he was guilty to-day if they hadn't said so five years ago. It is my information that he has paid every cent of the damages, whether he caused them or not, and it is my intention to go and call 41 upon Mr. Hayne as soon as he's settled.

{"utterance": "I have been reading over your letter of Thursday last, dear Steven, and there is much that I feel I ought to answer. You and Kate are very much of a mind about the temptations' with which I am surrounded; but you are far more imaginative than she is, and far more courteous. There is so much about your letter that touches me deeply that I want to be frank and fair in my reply. I have been dancing all this evening, was out at dinner before that, and have made many calls this afternoon; but, tired as I am, my 81 letter must be written, for to-morrow will be but the repetition of today. Is it that I am cold and utterly heartless that I can sit and write so calmly in reply to your fervent and appealing letter? Ah, Steven, it is what may be said of me; but, if cold and heartless to you, I have certainly given no man at this garrison the faintest reason to think that he has inspired any greater interest in him. They are all kind, all very attentive. I have told you how well Mr. Royce dances and Mr. Merton rides and Mr. Foster reads and talks. They entertain me vastly, and I do like it. More than this, Steven, I am pleased with their evident admiration,-not alone pleased and proud that they should admire me who am pledged to you,-not that alone, I frankly confess, but because it in itself is pleasant. It pleases me. Very possibly it is because I am vain.\nAnd yet, though my hours are constantly occupied, though they are here from morning till night, no one of them is more attentive than another. There are or six who come daily. There are some do not come at all. Am I a wretch, Steven? There are two or three that do not call who I wish would call.\nYet they know they could not help it, with Kate here, and I never forget that I am your promised wife. Steven, do you not sometimes forget the conditions of that promise? Even now, again and again do I not repeat to you that you ought to release me and free yourself? Of course your impulse will be to say my heart is changing,\n-that I have seen others whom I like better. No, I have seen no one I like as well. But is 'like' what you deserve,-what you ask? and is it not all I have ever been able to promise you? Steven, bear me witness, for Kate is bitterly unjust to me at times, I told you again and again last summer and fall that I did not love you and ought not to think of being your wife. Yet, poor, homeless, dependent as I am, how strong was the temptation to say yes to your plea! You know that I did not and would not until time and again your sweet mother, whom I do love, and Kate, who had been a mother to me, both declared that that should make no difference: the love would come: the happiest marriages the world over were those in which the girl respected the man of her choice: love would come, and come speedily, when once she was his wife. You yourself declared you could wait in patience, you would woo and win by and by. Only promise to be your wife before returning to the frontier, and you would be content. Steven, are you content? You know you are not; you know you are unhappy; and D* it is all, not because I am growing to love some one else, but because 1 am not growing to love you. Heaven knows I want to love you; for so long as you hold me to it my promise is sacred and shall be kept.\nMore than that, if you say that it is your will that I seclude myself from these attentions, give up dancing, give up rides, drives, walks, and even receiving visits, here, so be it. I will obey. But write this to me, Steven, not to Kate. I am too proud to ask her to show me the letters I know she has received from you,\u2014and there are some she has not shown me, but I cannot understand a man's complaining to other persons of the conduct of the woman who is, or is to be, his wife.\nForgive me if I pain you: sometimes even to myself I seem old and strange. I have lived so much alone, have had to think and do for myself so many years while Kate has been away, that perhaps I'm not like other girls; but the respect I feel for you would be injured if I thought you strove to guide or govern me through others; and of one thing be sure, Steven, I must honor and respect and look up to the man I marry, love or no love.\nOnce you said it would kill you if you believed I could be false to you. If by that you meant that, having given my promise to you to be your wife at some future time, I must school myself to love you, and will be considered false if love do not come at my bidding or yours, I say to you solemnly, release me now. I may not love, but I cannot and will not deceive you, even by simulating love that does not exist.\nSuppose that love were to be kindled in my heart. Suppose I were to learn to care for some one here. You would be the first one to know it; for I would tell you as soon as I knew it myself. Then what could. \u00cd hope for,\u2014or you? Surely you would not want to marry a girl who loved another man. But is it much better to marry one who feels that she does not love you? Think of it, Steven: I am very lonely, very far from happy, very wretched over Kate's evident trouble and all the sorrow I am bringing you and yours; but have I misled or deceived you in any one thing? Once only has a word been spoken or a scene occurred that you could perhaps have objected to. I told you the whole thing in my letter of Sunday last, and why I had not told Kate.\nWe have not met since that night, Mr. Hayne and I, and may not; but he is a man whose story excites my profound pity and sorrow, and he is one of the two or three I feel that I would like to see more of.\nIs this being false to you or to my promise? If so, Steven, you cannot say that I have not given you the whole truth.\nIt is very late at night,\u2014one o'clock,-and Kate is not yet asleep, and the captain is still down-stairs, reading. He is not looking well at all, and Kate is sorely anxious about him. It was his evidence that brought years of ostracism and misery upon Lieutenant Hayne, and there are vague indications that in his own regiment the officers are beginning to believe that possibly he was not the guilty man. The cavalry officers, of course, say nothing to us on the subject, and I have never heard the full story. If he has been, as is suggested, the victim of a scoundrel, and Captain Rayner was at fault in his evidence, no punishment on earth could be too great for the villain who planned his ruin, and no remorse could atone for Captain Rayner's share. I never saw so sad a face on mortal man as Mr. Hayne's. Steven Van Antwerp, I wish I were a man! I would trace that mystery to the bitter end.\nThis is a strange letter to send to-to you; but I am a strange girl. Already I am more than expecting you to write and release me unconditionally; and you ought to do it. I do not say I want it.\nFaithfully, at least, yours, NELLIE.\nP.S.-Should you write to Kate, you are not to tell her, remember, of my meeting with Mr. Hayne.

We are so unlikely to meet at all that you can afford to indulge me this once. In five long years I have heard no words from a woman's lips that gave me such joy and comfort as those you spoke so hurriedly and without premeditation. Only those who know anything of what my past has been could form any idea of the emotion with which I heard you. If I could not have seen you to say how-how I thanked you, I would have had to write. This explains what I said awhile ago: I owe you more pleasure than I can ever give.\nBut one thing was certain: I could not bear the idea that you should not be told, and by me, how grateful your words were to me,-how grateful I was to you.

There was nothing but the evidence to go upon, and that was all against you. The court was made up of officers from other regiments, and was at least impartial.\nThe evidence was almost all from your own, and was presumably well founded. You would call no witnesses for defence. You made your almost defiant statement; refused counsel; refused advice; and what could the court do but convict and sentence?

As for your previous ideas of that officer, I consider it too delicate a matter to speak of. You must see, however, how entirely beyond reproach his general character appears to have been.

{"utterance": "It is more than she did in the -th, sir. She was a handsome, showy woman when I first saw her, before my promotion to the regiment, and Clancy was one of the finest soldiers in the brigade the last year of the war. She ran through all his money, though, and in the -th we looked upon her as the real cause of his break-down, especially after her affair with that sergeant who deserted. You've heard of him, probably. He disappeared after the Battle Butte campaign, and we hoped he'd run off with Mrs. Clancy; but he hadn't.

{"utterance": "Yes: it was mainly on the woman's account we wouldn't re-enlist Clancy in the \u2015th. We could stan 1 him, but she was too much for us, -and for the other sergeant, too. He avoided her before we started on the campaign, I fancy. Odd!

He looks upon Chester-and it's one thing Chester hasn't forgiven in him-as a meddling old granny; you remember the time he so spoke of him last year; but he holds you in respect, or is afraid of you,\u2014which in a man of his calibre is about the same thing.\nIt may not be too late for you to act.

We are engaged; and-I love him. He has enemies here, as I see all too plainly, and they have prejudiced mother against him, and she has forbidden my seeing him. I came out to the fort without her knowledge one day, and it angered her. From that time she would not let me see him alone.\nShe watched every movement, and came with me wherever I drove.\nShe gave orders that I should never have any of our horses to drive or ride alone,-I, whom father had indulged to the utmost and who had ridden and driven at will from my babyhood.. She came out to the fort with me that evening for parade, and never even agreed to let me go out to see some neighbors until she learned he was to escort Miss Renwick. She had ordered me to be ready to go with her to Chequamagon the next day, and I would not go until I had seen him.\nThere had been a misunderstanding. I got the Suttons to drive me out while mother supposed me at the Laurents', and Mr. Jerrold promised to meet me east of the bridge and drive in town with us, and I was to send him back in Graves's buggy. He had been refused permission to leave the post, he said, and could not cross the bridge, where the sentries would be sure to recognize him, but, as it was our last chance of meeting, he risked the discovery of his absence, never dreaming of such a thing as his private rooms being inspected. He had a little skiff down in the willows that he had used before, and by leaving the party at midnight he could get home, change his dress, run down the bank and row down-stream to the Point, there leave his skiff and climb up. to the road. He met us there at one o'clock, and the Suttons would never betray either of us, though they did not know we were engaged.\nWe sat in their parlor`a quarter of an hour after we got to town, and then 'twas time to go, and there was only a little ten minutes' walk down to the stable.

Even when we got to the Point I did not let him go at once. It was over an hour's drive. It was fully half-past three before we parted. He sprang down the path to reach the river-side; and before he was fairly in his boat and pulling up against the stream, I heard, far over here somewhere, those two faint shots. That was the shooting he spoke of in his letter to me,-not to her; and what business Colonel Maynard had to read and exhibit to his officers a letter never intended for him I cannot understand. Mr. Jerrold says it was not what he wanted it to be at all, as he wrote hastily, so he wrote another, and sent that to me by Merrick that morning after his absence was discovered.

This would give us a chance to meet again, as he could spend the evening in St. Croix and return by late train, and I wrote and asked him. He came; we had a long talk in the summer-house in the garden, for mother never dreamed of his being there, and unluckily he just missed the night train and did not get back until inspection.

{"utterance": "No. I promised not to while I lived; but it's the simplest matter in the world, and no one at the colonel's had any hand in it. They never saw this one that I got to show Sloat. It is burned now. I said 'twas given me. That was hardly the truth.

{"utterance": "You are right in saying that the matter of my possession of that photograph should be explained. I seek no longer to palliate my action. In making that puppyish bet with Sloat I did believe that I could induce Miss Renwick or her mother to let me have a copy; but I was refused so positively that I knew it was useless. This simply added to my desire to have one. The photographer was the same that took the pictures and furnished the albums for our class at graduation, and I, more than any one, had been instrumental in getting the order for him against very active opposition. He had always professed the greatest gratitude to me and a willingness to do anything for me. I wrote to him in strict confidence, told him of the intimate and close relations existing between the colonel's family and me, told him 1 wanted it to enlarge and present to her mother on her approaching birthday, and promised him that I would never reveal how I came by the picture so long as I lived; and he sent me one,-just in time.\nHave I not paid heavily for my sin ?", "speaker": "Howard Jerrold", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Frank Armitage", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Proud and sensitive as I am, the knowledge that every man in my regiment has turned from me, that I have not a friend among them, that there is no longer a place for me in their midst,-more than all, that I deserve their contempt, has broken my heart. We will be in battle before the setting of another sun. Any man who seeks death in Indian fight can find it easily enough, and I can compel their respect in spite of themselves. They will not recognize me, living, as one of them.; but dying on the field, they have to place me on their roll of honor.", "speaker": "Howard Jerrold", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Nina Beaubien", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

I had told her we were nothing to each other, you and I. More than that, I was seeking her love; I hoped I could win her; and had she loved me I would have turned from you to make her my wife.

{"utterance": "Whatever our friends and fellow-citizens may think on the subject, I hold that the profession of the soldier is to the full as honorable as any in civil life; and it is liable at any moment to be more useful. I do not mean the officer alone. I say, and mean, the soldier. As for me, I would rather be first sergeant of my troop or company, or sergeant-major of my regiment, than any lieutenant in it except the adjutant. Hope of promotion is all that can make a subaltern's life endurable, but the staff-sergeant or the first sergeant, honored and respected by his officers, decorated for bravery by Congress, and looked up to by his comrades, is a king among men. The pay has nothing 319 to do with it.
