Social organization to-day, with the influences that environ it, is one of those phenomena which occur but once in a century. On all sides murmurs, mut terings as of an approaching storm! Men doubtful of the ground they walk on-new ideas dazzling them-old institutions crumbling-the hand upon the wall tracing, in fiery letters, the mysterious future-that future crammed with storms-groaning like a womb which holds the destiny of humanity! The heavens are dark, the ways we tread devious and full of hidden snares. England, our tender mother, might say, who planted them? For England, from whose loins we sprung, has cursed us!-like a stepmother, she has struck, with a bitter and remorseless hatred, those who would be her children! She cursed us with this race of Africans who are eating us up and ruining us, and some day, in the blind convulsions of her rage, she will taunt us bitterly for asking what we do not grant ourselves\u2014for demanding freedom, when our arms are holding down a race human as ourselves! Let her gnash her teeth in impotent and irrational complaint!-let her complain, we will not\u00b7 for God decreed that she herself, black with crime and in justice, should be the means of bringing hither this race, that in the future Christianity should dawn on that vast con tinent of Africa-that land where the very air seems tainted with paganism-where the very palms which wave their long plumes on the ocean breeze seem celebrating some horrible rite! No; this is not the head and front of the accusation which, in the name of justice and humanity, we bring against England. She has thrust upon us her despotic regulations.\nShe has contracted suffrage. She has given to Lord Culpeper the whole territory from the mouth of the Rappahannock to the sources of the Potomac-enthroned him a prince and king over us! She has crushed our commerce by navigation laws which are so odious and unrighteous that the very instruments of her tyranny shrink from enforcing them! With a blind, remorseless hatred-a policy destitute of reason as it is foul with injustice and wrong-she has bound on this poor laboring brute, Virginia, burdens which crush her, under which she staggers, groaning, and tearing herself with rage, terror, and despair! She has made for herself a gospel whose commandments are-Thou shalt steal''Thou shalt bear false witness against thy neighbor'-'Thou shalt have no other god but George III.' She has gone on from wrong to wrong, from injustice to injustice, until like those unhappy creatures whom the gods intend to strike, she has grown mad, lost her brain, her reason, braced herself to rush upon an obstacle which will hurl her back, as a wave of the ocean is hurled back from the cliff of eternal stone! Yes, sir, that empire rushes upon what will tame her! Already she speaks of an act decreeing that a stamp shall be placed upon every instrument written or printed of human affairs. Journals, deeds, conveyances-pleadings in law, bills of lading-on the marriage contract, and the bill for the headstone--nothing to be operative without that stamp! Well, sir, that act will make the cup filled with the bitter and poisonous draught run over-that law will make the infuriated animal, thrown on her knees, rise up, and then, sir, God alone knows where things will end!
