She was never heard from after they left Cal lao. I wa'n't left very well off ; we 'd had consider able sickness, and his father and mother and a foolish sister made it their home with us and was consider able expense. I always set a great deal by Father Parker, though. He was a real good man and he always did what he could. He got frost-bit down to the Banks, one winter, and bis hands and feet were crippled. We had hard scratchin' one spell : but my boys and girls got so 's they could work, and then there wa'n't any more trouble. I 've had a good deal to be thankful for ; but I 've seen the time I 'd a-laid down and died, I was so discouraged. I live with my youngest daughter now, and she 's got as handsome a little farm as you ever see and a good husband. He 's doing well, too. They are always thinking o' things to please me, both of 'em.

I hoped I should see him stand up and preach in the old meeting-house. Some of his sermons were thought a great deal of. I could n't always understand the deeper thought in 'em, We set a good many times to come on ; and we did get as far as New York once, to the meetings of the American Board, and then somehow there was always some place we thought we must go to first, out West. It ain't that we 've stayed right in the same place all these years, she explained. My brother used to travel about a good deal. Seems to me, coming back this way, I miss him more than ever.
