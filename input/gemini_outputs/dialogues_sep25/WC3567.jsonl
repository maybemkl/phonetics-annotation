{"utterance": "\u039c' Y DEAR BELLE: Well, here we are, Harry and I, all settled down to housekeeping quite like old folks. All is about done but the last things,\u2014those little touches, and improvements, and alterations that go off into airy perspective. I believe it was Carlyle that talked about an \"infinite shoe-black\" whom all the world could not quite satisfy so but that there would always be a next thing in the distance. Well, perhaps it's going to be so in housekeeping, and I shall turn out an infinite housekeeper; for I find this little, low-studded, unfashionable home of ours, far off in a tabooed street, has kept all my energies brisk and busy for a month past, and still there are more worlds to conquer. Visions of certain brackets and lambrequins that are to adorn my spare chamber visit my pillow nightly, while Harry is placidly sleeping the sleep of the just. I have been unable to attain to them because I have been so busy with my parlor ivies and my Ward's case of ferns, and some perfectly seraphic hanging baskets, gorgeous with flowering nasturtiums that are now blooming in my windows. There is a dear little Quaker dove of a woman living in the next house to ours who is a perfect witch at gardening-a good kind of witch, you understand, one who could make a broomstick bud and blossom if she undertook it -and she has been my teacher and exemplar in these matters. Her parlor is a perfect bower, a drab dove's nest wreathed round with vines and all a-bloom with ger- So aniums; and mine is coming on to look just like it. So you see all this has kept me ever so busy. Then there are the family accounts to keep. You may think that isn't much for our little concern, but you would be amazed to find how much there is in it. You see, I have all my life concerned myself only with figures of speech and never gave a thought about figures of arithmetic or troubled my head as to where money came from, or went to; and when I married Harry I had a gen- eral idea that we were going to live with delightful econ- omy. But it is astonishing how much all our simplicity costs, after all. My account-book is giving me a world of new ideas, and some pretty serious ones too. Harry, you see, leaves every thing to me. He has to be off to his office by seven o'clock every morning, and I am head marshal of the commisariat department-com- mittee of one on supplies, and all that\u2014and it takes up a good deal of my time. You would laugh, Belle, to see me with my matronly airs and graces going my daily walk to the provision- store at the corner, which is kept by a tall, black-browed lugubrious man, with rough hair and a stiff stubby beard, who surveys me with a severe gravity over the counter, as if he wasn't sure that my designs were quite honest.\"", "speaker": "Eva Henderson", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Belle", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

The first evening you had, he walked round and round me nearly the whole evening, and never spoke a word; then suddenly he came and sat down by me, when I was sitting by Mrs. Betsey, and gave me a message from the Prices; but he spoke in such a stiff, embarrassed way, and then there was an awful pause, and suddenly he got up and went away again; and poor little Mrs. Betsey said, 'Bless me, how stiff and ungracious he is'; and I said that I believed he wasn't much used to society-but, after a while, this wore away, and he became very social, and we grew better and better acquainted all the time. Although I was a little contradictious, and used to controvert some of his notions, I fancy it was rather a novelty to him to find somebody that didn't always give up to him, for, I must say, some of the women that go to our chapel do make fools of themselves about him. It really provokes me past all bearing. If any body could set me against a man, it would be those silly, admiring women who have their hands and eyes always raised in adoration, whatever he does. It annoys him, I can see, for it is very much against his taste, and he likes me because, he says, I always will tell him the truth.'\"", "speaker": "Angelique Van Arsdel", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Eva Henderson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Oh, and she has altered her opinion entirely about his ritualism. The Bishop, she says, stands by him; and what the Bishop doesn't condemn, nobody has any right to; and then she sets forth what a good family he belongs to, and so well connected!

She will have exactly the right people, and exactly the right things to give them. Her rooms will be lovely. She will be dressed herself to a T, and she will say just the right thing to everybody. All her nice silver and her pretty things will come out of their secret crypts and recesses to do honor to the occasion, and, for one night, all will be suavity and sociability personified; and then everything will go back into lavender, the silver to the safe, the chairs and lounges to their cover, the shades will come down, and her part of the world's debt of sociability will be done up for the year. Then she will add up the expense, and set it down in her account book, and that thing 'll be finished and checked off.", "speaker": "Alice", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Eva Henderson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "Well, you see, darling, I've sometimes thought whether it was quite fair to let any one be so very intimate with one, unless one were willing to take the consequences, in case his feelings should become deeply involved. Now, we should have thought it a bad thing for Mr. St. John to go on cultivating an intimate friendship with Angie, if he never meant to marry. It would be taking from her feelings and affections that might be given to some one who would make her happy for life; and I think some women, I don't mean you, of course, but some women I have seen and heard of, like to absorb all the feeling and devotion a man has without in the least intending to marry him. They keep him from being interested in any one else who might make him a happy home, and won't have him themselves.", "speaker": "Eva Henderson", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Alice", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "Oh, dear me, that's just what I've been fearing, is n't it too bad? I really do n't think it's my fault. Do you know, Eva, I came here meaning to go home to-night, and I stayed only because I was afraid to walk home with Jim. I was sure if I did there would be a crisis of some kind.", "speaker": "Alice", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Eva Henderson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Oh! not at all", "speaker": "Alice", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Eva Henderson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "And when you have got such a man, you will have to ask him to go to market for beef and cranberry sauce. You will have to get him to match your worsted, and carry your parcels, and talk over with him about how to cure the chimney of smoking and make the kitchen range draw. Don't you think a hero will be a rather cumbersome help in housekeeping?", "speaker": "Eva Henderson", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Alice", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
{"utterance": "Besides, your heroes like to sit on pedestals and have you worship them. Now, for my part, I'd rather have a good kind man that will worship me.\n'A creature not too bright and good\nFor human nature's daily food.'\nA man like Harry, for instance. Harry isn't a hero; he's a good, true, noble-hearted boy, though, and I'd rather have him than the angel Gabriel, if I could choose now. I don't see what's to object to in Jim, if you like him and love him, as you say. He's handsome; he's lively and cheerful; he's kind-hearted and obliging; and he's certainly true and constant in his affections: and now he has a good position, and one where he can do a good work in the world, and your influence might help him in it.", "speaker": "Eva Henderson", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Alice", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "Well, really, I do think it would be a nice thing for us all if you could like Jim, for he's one of us; we all know him and like him, and he wouldn't take you away to the ends of the earth; you might settle right down here, and live near us, and all go on together cosily. Jim is just the fellow to make a bright, pleasant, hospitable home; and he's certain to be a devoted husband to whomever he marries.", "speaker": "Eva Henderson", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Alice", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "Well, I happen to know just how much that amounts to. Jim never would have a serious thought of Jane Stuyvesant-that I'm certain of. She's a perfectly frivolous girl, and he knows it.", "speaker": "Alice", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Eva Henderson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "What, Sophia Stephenson! You could n't have got more out of the way. Why, no! Why, she's nothing but a breathing wax doll; that's all there is to her.

{"utterance": "Oh, nothing at all, except that she was a dashing, flirting young thing that took a fancy to Jim and invited him to her opera box, and of course Jim went. The fact is, Jim is good-looking and lively and gay, and will go a certain way with any nice girl. He likes to have a jolly, good time; but he has his own thoughts about them all, as I happen to know. There is n't one of these that he has a serious thought of.", "speaker": "Alice", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Eva Henderson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

I'll tell you, Eva, if anything could incline me more to such a decision, it's the way Aunt Maria has talked about Jim to me-setting him down as if he was the last and most improbable parti I could choose; and as if, of course, I never could even think of him.

Think of her actually\ngoing up there to church last Sunday, and not saying a\nword about the candles, or the chantings, or any of the\nabominations! She only remarked that she was sure she\nnever heard a better Gospel sermon than Mr. St. John\npreached-which was true enough.

{"utterance": "As far as I can perceive, it is this: when old women like you and me are stockholders, it means that a company of men take our money and use it for their own purposes, and pay us what they like, when it comes convenient; and when it's not convenient, they don't pay us at all.

That was going to make our everlasting fortune. There was no end to the talk about what it would do-and all of a sudden the bank burst up, and my money was all gone-never gave me back a cent! and I should like to know where it went to.

The fact is, I have got so nervous about burglars that I am up and down two or three times a night.", "speaker": "Betsey Benthusen", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Eva Henderson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

{"utterance": "Jack is a good watch dog-he's very alert; but the trouble is, he barks just as loud when there is n't any- thing going on as when there is. Night after night, that dog has started us both up with such a report, and I'd go all over the house and find nothing there. Some- times I think he hears people trying the doors or win- dows. Altogether, I think Jack frightens me more than he helps, though I know he does it all for the best, and I tell Dorcas so when he wakes her up.
