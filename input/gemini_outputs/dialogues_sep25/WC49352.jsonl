As soon as I grew to be ten years old I saw all this, and I resolved that low birth and poverty should not crush me. I worked in the garden of a nobleman in the neighborhood, and earned some money. With this I bought books and taught myself to read. Then I taught myself to write. Having learned the use of my tools, I began to use them. I had studied natural science for five years, and was sixteen when I wrote a thesis on elec tricity for the annual prize at Strasburg College. It was crowned, and I was paid a thousand livres. I went to a German col lege, studied, graduated ; and at twenty-five was professor at Gottingen.

To have imagined the possibility of any one being unkind to her, or of her suf fering from neglect even, would have seem ed to me madness. Well, to sum up what happened. At sixteen she attracted the at tentions of a young man of twenty, in the city where at that time we resided. He was wealthy, fine-looking, modest in deport ment, and seemed devoted body and soul to my child. He came to me and told me this, asking my consent to his union with my daughter. I refused this assent she was too young ; but he replied that he would wait, and then he left me. In spite of my opposition, the affair was not broken oif.

What I know is that he*\nhas crushed me, and I see that lie is what\nhe is called, a God of Vengeance, since at\none blow he has swept away one-half of my\nlife. This was what I said to myself. Well,\nI no longer say it. I think or think that\nI think I see more justly. Yes, the attri\nbute of Vengeance is his, but another attri\nbute co-exists with it. He made man in his\nown image, having his attributes of thought,\nfree-will, the capacity to love ; and I no lon\nger ask myself why man was made. God is\nlove, as well as vengeance. It is the neces\nsity of love that it should have something\nto love. Thus man was created with the\nuniverse to administer to him, as the object\nof the Almighty's love ; and as love must\nbe free to choose its object or reject it, man\nwas given, free-will, the power to choose ;\nhence the whole scheme of redemption.", "speaker": "Professor Pressensee", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "narrator", "addressee_in_char_list": false}
