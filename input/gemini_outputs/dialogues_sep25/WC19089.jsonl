Thus if I wanted to spell the word 'regiments,' which Sid suggests, I would have to signal '18, 5, 7, 9, 13, 5, 14, 20, 19' and you would read it, after we have practiced it long enough to know the number of each letter, as readily as you would understand me if I spelled it out in letters.", "speaker": "Sam Hardwicke", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Sid Russell", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
