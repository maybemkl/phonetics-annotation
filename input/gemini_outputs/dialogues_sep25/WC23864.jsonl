You see there's no career at all for a married woman in this country, as there is in France. Marriage there opens a brilliant prospect before a girl: it introduces her to the world; it gives her wings. In America, it is clipping her wings, chaining her down, shutting her up, -no more gayety, no more admiration; nothing but cradles and cribs, and bibs and tuckers, little narrowing, wearing, domestic cares, hard, vulgar domestic slaveries: and so our women lose their bloom and health and freshness, and are moped to death.", "speaker": "Mrs. Follingsbee", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mrs. Ferguson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

The French are a philosophical nation; and, in Paris, you see, this thing is all systematic: it's altogether better for the child.\nIt's taken to the country, and put to nurse with a good strong woman, who makes that her only business. She just lives to be a good animal, you see, and so is a\n\nbetter one than a more intellectual being can be; thus she gives the child a strong constitution, which is the main thing.", "speaker": "Mrs. Follingsbee", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mrs. Ferguson", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

The reason, he inferred, was the perfection of the system which keeps the French family reduced in numbers. The babies are out at nurse, sometimes till two, and sometimes till three years of age; and, at seven or eight, the girl goes into a pension, and the boy into a college, till they are ready to be taken out, - the girl to be married, and the 12\n\nboy to enter a profession: so the leisure of parents for literature, art, and society is preserved.", "speaker": "Letitia", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Mrs. Follingsbee", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

It is not often that a woman can get an establishment like yours, and a good man into the bargain; so, if the goodness is a little ennuyeuse, one must put up with it. Then, again, people of old established standing may do about what they like socially: their position is made. People only say,' Well, that is their way; the Seymours will do so and so.' Now, we have to do twice as much of every thing to make our position, as certain other people do. We might flood our place with champagne and Burgundy, and get all the young fellows drunk, as we generally do; and yet people will call our parties' bourgeois,' and yours'recherche,'\nif you give them nothing but tea and biscuit. Now,\n\nthere's my Dick: he respects your husband; you can see he does.

I gathered that it would not have been impossible per se, as metaphysicians say, to look with favor on your humble servant.\n Gracie, I have been living, I trust, not unworthily of you. Your photograph has been with me round the world, \u2014 in the miner's tent, on shipboard, among scenes where barbarous men do congregate; and everywhere it has been a presence,'to warn, to comfort, to command;' and if I have come out of many trials firmer, better, more established in right than before; if I am more believing in religion, and in every way grounded and settled in the way you would\n have me, -it has been your spiritual presence and yowr power over me that has done it. Besides that, I may as well tell you, I have never given up the hope that by and by you would see all this, and in some hour give me a different answer.\n\"WVVhen, therefore, I learned of your father's death, and afterwards of John's marriage, I thought it was time for me to return again. I have come to New York, and, if you do not forbid, shall come to Springdale.\n Will you be a little glad to see me, Gracie? Why not? We are both alone now. Let us take hands, and walk the same path together. Shall we?\nYours till death, and after, \"C WALTER SYDENHAM.", "speaker": "Walter Sydenham", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Grace", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

It is your self-abnegation, you dear over-good women, that makes us men seem selfish.\nWe should be as good as you are, if you would give us the chance. I think, Gracie, though you're not aware of it, there is a spice of Pharisaism in the way in which you good girls allow us men to swallow you up without ever telling us what you are doing. I often wondered about your intimacy with Sydenham, and why it never came to any thing; and I can but half forgive you.

You see Sydenham will be down here at once; and it wouldn't be exactly the thing for you to receive him at this house, and our only hotel is perfectly impracticable in winter; and that brings me to what I am here about. Lillie is going to New York to spend the holidays; and I wanted you to shut up, and come up and keep house for us.\nYou see you have only one servant, and we have four to be looked after.

Between you and me, it strikes me that that Mrs. Follingsbee is an affected goose; but I couldn't say so to Lillie,' by no manner of means.' She professes an untold amount of admiration and friendship for Lillie, and sets such brilliant prospects before her, that I should be the most hard-hearted old Turk in existence if I were to raise any objections; and, in fact, Lillie is quite brilliant in anticipation, and makes herself so delightful that I am almost sorry that I agreed to let her go.", "speaker": "John Seymour", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Grace", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

Les convenances, you know, are the all-important things. I send her presents constantly, and send my carriage around to take her to church or opera, or any thing that is going on, and have her children at my fancy parties: yet, for all that, the creature has not a particle. of gratitude; those narrow-minded women never have.

How can the artistic nature exercise itself in the very grind of the thing, when this child has a cold, and the other the croup; and there is fussing with mustard-paste and ipecac and paregoric, all those realities, you know?  Why, Charlie tells me he feels a great deal more affection for his children when he is all calm and tranquil in the little boudoir at our house; and he writes such lovely little poems about them, I must show you some of them.

{"utterance": "Miss Ferguson, I confess I have been wrong and done wrong; but, if you knew all, you might see how I have been led into it. That woman has been the evil fate of my life. Years ago, when we were both young, I loved her as honestly as man could love a woman; and she professed to love me in return. But I was poor; and she would not marry me. She sent me off, yet she would not let me forget her. She would always write to me just enough to keep up hope and interest; and she knew for years that all my object in striving for fortune was to win her. At last, when a lucky stroke made me suddenly rich, and I came home to seek her, I found her married, - married, as she owns, without love, - married for wealth and ambition.  I don't justify myself, \u2014I don't pretend to; but when she met me with her. old smiles and her old charms, and told me she loved me still, it roused the very devil in me. I wanted revenge.

You men are stronger than we: you have the world in your hands; you have a thousand resources where we have only one. And you ought to be stronger and nobler according to your advantages; you ought to rise superior to the temptations that beset a poor, weak, ill-educated woman, whom everybody has been flattering from her cradle, and whom you, I dare say, have helped to flatter, turning her head with compliments, like all the rest of them.

Did you ever try to strengthen her principles, to educate her mind, to mnake her strong? On the contrary, haven't you been bowing down and adoring her for being weak?\nIt seems to me that Lillie is exactly the kind of woman that you men educate, by the way you look on women, and the way you treat them.", "speaker": "Rose Ferguson", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Harry Endicott", "addressee_in_char_list": true}

That is generous, is' it not?\nI think, after all, Noah Claypole isn't so very uncommon a picture of the way that your lordly sex turn round and cast all the blame on ours. You will never make me believe in a protracted flirtation between a gentleman and lady, where at least half the blame does not lie on his lordship's side. I always said that a woman had no need to have offers made her by a man she could not love, if she conducted herself properly; and I think the same is true in regard to men.

By your own account of the matter, you have been encouraging and keeping up a sort of silly, romantic excitement in her.\nIt is worse than silly; it is sinful. It is trifling with her best interests in this life and the life to come. And I think you must know that, if you had treated her like an honest, plain-spoken brother or cousin, without any trumpery of gallantry or sentiment, things would have never got to be as they are.

Well, I suppose people are happier for being made so; people that have no sensibility are better fitted to get through the world. But, gracious me! I can't understand such people. There she stood at the grave, looking so calm, when Charlie was s6bbing so that he could hardly hold himself up. Well, it really wasn't respectable. I think, at least, I would keep my veil down, and keep my handkerchief up. Poor Charlie! he came to me at last; and I gave way. I was completely broken down, I must confess. Poor fellow! he told me there was no conceiving his misery. That baby was the very idol of his soul; all his hopes of life were centred in it. He really felt tempted to rebel at Providence.

You sacrifice all your property to pay an indorsement for a\ndebt that is not yours; and why do you do it? Because society rests on every man's faithfulness to his engagements. John, if you stand by a business engagement with this faithfulness, how much more should you stand by that great engagement which concerns all other families and the stability of all society.> Lillie is your wife. You were free to choose; and you chose her.\nShe is the mother of your child; and, John, what that daughter is to be depends very much on the steadiness with which you fulfil your duties to the mother. I know that Lillie is a most undeveloped and uncongenial person; I know how little you have in common: but your duties are the same as if she were the best and the most congenial of wives.

It seems to me that we can make up our minds to bear any thing that we know must come; and you may as well make tp yours, that, for a long time, you will have to carry Lillie as a burden. But then, you must think that she is your daughter's mother, and that it is very important for the child that she should respect and honor her mother. You must treat her with respect and honor, even in her weaknesses. We all must.

You know that you think it nobler to be an honest man than a rich man; and I am sure that you will think it better to be a good man tlhan to be a happy one. Now, dear John, it is not I that say these things, I think; but it seems to me it is what our mother would say, if she should speak to you from where she is.

There may be arrangements made when the creditors come together. My impression is that, whenever people find a man really determined to arrange a matter of this kind honorably, they are all disposed to help him; so don't be cast down about the business.

It has troubled me; it has come with a strange kind of pain. I have never suffered so much.
