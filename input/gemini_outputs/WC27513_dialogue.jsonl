Their shares fell from 270 to 95 ; the supposed value of the  land fell with them, and finally the moment arrived when  we could purchase for a very moderate sum. I see the ques tion in your mind ; why should we wish to buy when the  other wells were giving out ? There comes in the secret, which is oui' veritable success. Consider it whispered in  your ears, and locked in your bosoms, torpedoes ! It was  not then generally exploded (to carry out the image), so we  bought at the low figure, in the very nick of time. Within  a week the Fhike and Chowder Wells were torpedoed, and  came back to more than their former capacity ; the shares  rose as rapidly as they had fallen, and the central body we  hold to which they are, as it were, the two arms could  now be sold for ten times what it cost us !", "speaker": "Mr. Blessing", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Joseph Asten", "addressee_in_char_list": true}
