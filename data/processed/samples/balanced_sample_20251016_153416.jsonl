And then I felt a sort of strange sense that something was coming some great trial or affliction - and I groaned and clung to Moses, and asked him to put his arm around me and hold me. Then it seemed to be not by our sea-shore that this was happening, but by the Sea of Galilee, just as it tells about it in the Bible, and there were fishermen mending their nets, and men sitting counting their money, and I saw Jesus come walking along, and heard him say to this one and that one, ‘Leave all and follow me,’ and it seemed that the moment he spoke they did it, and then he came to me, and I felt his eyes in my very soul, and he said, ‘Wilt thou leave all and follow me?’ I cannot tell now what a pain I felt what an anguish. I wanted to leave all, but my heart felt as if it were tied and woven with a thousand threads, and while I waited he seemed to fade away, and I found myself then alone and unhappy, wishing that I could, and mourning that I had not; and then something shone out warm like the sun, and I looked up, and he stood there looking pitifully, and he said again just as he did before, ‘Wilt thou leave all and follow me?’ Every word was so gentle and full of pity, and I looked into his eyes and could not look away; they drew me, they warmed me, and I felt a strange, won- derful sense of his greatness and sweetness. It seemed as if I felt within me cord after cord breaking, I felt so free, so happy; and I said, ‘I will, I will, with all my heart;’ and I woke then, so happy, so sure of God's love. I saw so clearly how his love is in everything, and these words came into my mind as if an angel had spoken them, ‘God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.’ Since then I cannot be unhappy. I was so myself only this morning, and now I wonder that any one can have a grief when God is so loving and good, and cares so sweetly for us all.

I went with hope I had never known before, and that hope was killed long months ago, long before we lost all hope for the cause of our blessed South.

At this moment Mr. Pettingill is believed to be home on parole, but within easy call of that kittenish patte de velours at Leesburg. It is my belief that, in her longing to whip the whole Yankee nation as it deserves, Miss Waddell has determined to hold him for life, leaving the whippings to be administered in the by and by to a generation yet unborn.

{"text": "MY POOR DEAR OUTRAGED CHILD, -What can I say to you? There is no use in trying to prepare you for it, since you would never conceive such double-dyed blackness of heart! Tita has run away. She slipped off clandestinely, and they think she has followed Rast, who left yesterday on his way back to St. Louis and the West. Père Michaux has followed her, saying that if he found them together he should, acting as Tita's guardian, insist upon a marriage before he returned! He feels himself responsible for Tita, he says, and paid no attention when I asked him if no one was to be responsible for you! My poor child, it seems that I have been blind all along; I never dreamed of what was going on. The little minx deceived me completely. I thought her so much improved, so studious, while all the time she was meeting Erastus, or planning to meet him, with a skill far beyond my comprehension. All last summer, they tell me, she was with him constantly; those daily journeys to Père Michaux's island were for that purpose, while I supposed they were for prayers. What Erastus thought or meant, no one seems to know; but they all combined in declaring that the child (child no longer!) was deeply in love with him, and that everybody saw it save me. My New England blood could not, I am proud to say, grasp it! You know, my poor darling, the opinion I have always had concerning Tita's mother, who slyly and artfully inveigled your honored father into a trap. Tita has therefore but followed in her mother's footsteps. That Erastus has ever cared, or cares now in the least, for her, save as a plaything, I will never believe. But Père Michaux is like a mule for stubbornness, as you know, and I fear he will marry them in any case. He did not seem to think of you at all, and when I said, Anne will die of grief!' he only smiled-yes, smiled— and Frenchly shrugged his shoulders! My poor child, I have but little hope, because if he appeals to Erastus's honor, what can the boy do? He is the soul of honor. I can hardly write, my brain has been so overturned. To think that Tita should have outwitted us all at her age, and gained her point over everything, over you and over Rast-poor, poor Rast, who will be so miserably sacrificed! I will write again to-morrow; but if Père Michaux carries out his strange Jesuitical design, you will hear from him probably before you can hear again from me. Bear up, my dearest Anne. I acknowledge that, so far, I have found it difficult to see the Divine purpose in this, unless indeed it be to inform us that we are all but cinders and ashes; which, however, I for one have long known.", "meta": {"source": "gemini_data", "source_file": "WC9667.jsonl", "speaker": "Lois Hinsdale", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Anne Douglas", "addressee_in_char_list": true, "is_dialogue": true, "is_phonetized": true}}
