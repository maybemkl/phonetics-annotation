Take them along afoot for a time, and if your arguments are good, they will finally be willing to ride with you at a gallop. No man ever accomplished a great object without first preparing himself for the task. This is done by thoroughly saturating one's self with knowledge at the expense of ignorant conceit, the cultivation of patience at the expense of over-activity, reasonableness at the expense of petulance, and personal influence at the expense of austerity. And here let me remind you that personal influence is greatest when the ego is least, for when the ego is prominent one is catering to his own weakness, when he should be catering to the weaknesses of those he wishes to influence.\nPersonal influence based on knowledge always gives weight, while that based on conviviality gives lustre only, which in society goes farther than merit, but not so when dollars are involved.

I believe it was Carlyle that talked about an \"infinite shoe-black\" whom all the world could not quite satisfy so but that there would always be a next thing in the distance. Well, perhaps it's going to be so in housekeeping, and I shall turn out an infinite housekeeper; for I find this little, low-studded, unfashionable home of ours, far off in a tabooed street, has kept all my energies brisk and busy for a month past, and still there are more worlds to conquer. Visions of certain brackets and lambrequins that are to adorn my spare chamber visit my pillow nightly, while Harry is placidly sleeping the sleep of the just. I have been unable to attain to them because I have been so busy with my parlor ivies and my Ward's case of ferns, and some perfectly seraphic hanging baskets, gorgeous with flowering nasturtiums that are now blooming in my windows. There is a dear little Quaker dove of a woman living in the next house to ours who is a perfect witch at gardening-a good kind of witch, you understand, one who could make a broomstick bud and blossom if she undertook it -and she has been my teacher and exemplar in these matters. Her parlor is a perfect bower, a drab dove's nest wreathed round with vines and all a-bloom with ger- So aniums; and mine is coming on to look just like it. So you see all this has kept me ever so busy. Then there are the family accounts to keep. You may think that isn't much for our little concern, but you would be amazed to find how much there is in it. You see, I have all my life concerned myself only with figures of speech and never gave a thought about figures of arithmetic or troubled my head as to where money came from, or went to; and when I married Harry I had a gen- eral idea that we were going to live with delightful econ- omy. But it is astonishing how much all our simplicity costs, after all. My account-book is giving me a world of new ideas, and some pretty serious ones too. Harry, you see, leaves every thing to me. He has to be off to his office by seven o'clock every morning, and I am head marshal of the commisariat department-com- mittee of one on supplies, and all that—and it takes up a good deal of my time. You would laugh, Belle, to see me with my matronly airs and graces going my daily walk to the provision- store at the corner, which is kept by a tall, black-browed lugubrious man, with rough hair and a stiff stubby beard, who surveys me with a severe gravity over the counter, as if he wasn't sure that my designs were quite honest.\"", "meta": {"source": "gemini_data", "source_file": "WC3567.jsonl", "speaker": "Eva Henderson", "speaker_in_char_list": true, "addressee": "Belle", "addressee_in_char_list": true, "is_dialogue": true, "is_phonetized": true}}

Well, we'll call it a flight of fancy. That poor, stupid Dutchman, who was seen around that day by several witnesses, had about as much to do with the murder as my dog Major had. Now, that lane from Old Town Pond is a highway in everything but name. You all know as well as I do, people go across there every day in the week without being bound to the Detmold farm-house; I suppose we must call it the cot- tage now-quaint little cottage, and all that sort of thing. It's a mighty damp, rickety, old farm-house, in point of fact, but since it's been occupied by city people, it's politer to say it is a cottage. The folks that have been in it this year must have got used to having foot pas- sengers going through the yard, night and day. The place was shut up so long, everybody got in the habit of going along that way from Wickapogue and thereabouts; it cuts off half a mile or so. The tramp had as good a right as anybody to go through (that was no right at all, but he'd be as likely as any one to take it). He went through, most likely, when the fam- ily were in at tea, or maybe he struck off to the village through the fields before he got to the farm-yard. Again, the motive of the tramp was burglary, and no burglary has been committed; a footstool has been overturned and a couple of worthless articles are miss- ing. We won't waste time over that.

Her poor foolish mother had some gifts, but she went adrift very soon, and I should teach Nan her duty to her neighbor, and make her take in the idea that she owes something to the world beside following out her own most satisfying plans. When I was a young woman it was a most blessed discovery to me though I was not any quicker at making it than other people, perhaps, that, beside being happy myself and valuable to myself, I must fit myself into my place in society. We are seldom left to work alone, you know. No, not even you. I know too much about you to believe that. And it is n't enough that we are willing to talk about ourselves. We must learn to understand the subjects of the day that everybody talks about, and to make sure of a right to stand upon the highest common ground wherever we are. Society is a sort of close corporation, and we must know its watchwords, and keep an interest in its interests and affairs. I call a gentleman the man who, either by birth or by nature, belongs to the best society. There may be bad gentlemen and good gentlemen, but one must feel instinctively at home with a certain class, representatives of which are likely to be found everywhere. And as for Nan, you will be disappointed if she does not understand a little later your own way of looking at things. She must n't grow up full of whims and indifferences. I am too fond of you to look forward calmly to your being disappointed, and I do believe she will be a most lovely, daughterly, friendly girl, who will keep you from being lonely as you grow older, and be a great 185 blessing in every way.
